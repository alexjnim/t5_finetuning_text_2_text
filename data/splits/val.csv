"Drug peddlers are coating biscuits and nut crackers with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) drug to avoid being caught at airports, Task Force officials said. ""These biscuits were detected and seized only because the peddlers were carrying another drug, which was detected in the scanning machine,"" an officer said. This was revealed after Task Force arrested nine people carrying LSD-laced biscuits.","Summarise: Believe it or not, eatables laced with LSD are the emerging modus operandi followed by drug peddlers across the country, agencies dealing against narcotics claimed. Be it biscuits or nut crackers, drug peddlers are lacing them with LSD and selling them at higher price.The revelation came days after Task Force sleuths arrested nine people, including two Nigerians, in two separate cases at Masab Tank and Banjara Hills in Hyderabad. Along with 300 grams of cocaine, 42 grams of MDMA and three biscuits laced with LSD were recovered.According to sources, during interrogation, they told police that to save themselves from being caught at the airport, they started coating LSD on eatables such as biscuits and nut crackers. They further told police that this is not the first time they have laced eatables with LSD. ""Most of the drugs, especially LSD, coming from Germany to India are being coated on eatables,"" they reportedly confessed.LSD LACED EATABLESThe officers said that earlier LSD-laced sugar cubes were seized, but this is the first time drugs in biscuits were found. ""These biscuits were detected and seized only because the peddlers were carrying another drug as well, which was detected in the scanning machine,"" an officer involved in the investigation said.After recording the confessional statement, the inputs were shared with the narcotics department. Also, security agencies at the airports, including CISF, have been alerted about the new modus operandiSpeaking to Mail Today, a senior officer of the narcotics department said, ""It is very difficult to identify adultered eatables and eatables laced with LSD. But officers scanning passengers' luggage at the airport have been asked to keep tight vigil on eatables in their bags. Not only this, but they have been advised to check biscuits or nut crackers if they are in small quantity.""Sources also said peddlers - mostly from African countries - have been carrying small consignments which they hide between the clothes or in false cavities in their bags.""They also carry nut cracker packets in their hand bags to avoid suspicion. They keep the seal open and tend to eat some of them to fool security officers. Those arrested hid the eatables laced with LSD in a small false cavity inside the packet to fool the officers,"" a source said, quoting one of the confessional statements.Meanwhile, preliminary interrogation and analysis of cell phone data of the peddlers revealed they might have sold drugs to more than 100 people in the last one and half years.""Most buyers are young, especially college students,"" said an officer in the Task Force. In a separate case, West Zone Task Force arrested three people and seized 11 LSD bots and three cell phones. The accused are P Revanth, Irfan Najeeb Khan and Zain Khan."

"India's biggest listed blue-chip firms are paying their top executives salaries of up to 1,200 times the median employee remunerations, disclosures by top listed firms revealed. The pay packages of senior-most personnel rose at most private firms during 2016-17. Among the major Sensex firms, Lupin saw the ratio between the Chairman remuneration and the median employee remuneration at 1,263 times.","Summarise: A huge pay gap between CEOs and other employees at Indian companies has come to the fore, with the biggest listed blue-chip firms doling out to their top executives salary packages of up to 1,200-times of their median employee remunerations. An analysis of remuneration disclosures made by top listed companies forming part of the blue-chip index Sensex -- under directions of the capital markets regulator Sebi -- shows that the pay packages of senior-most personnel such as CEOs and executive chairmen continue to remain high and rose further at most private sector firms during 2016-17. TOP EXECUTIVES' PAY REMAINS HIGH On the contrary, the median employee remuneration fell or remained almost same during the last fiscal, while the ratio of the top executives' pay to the median employee remuneration remained at astronomically high levels of hundreds-times in many cases. The public sector companies show a totally different picture with their chiefs getting salaries of just about 3-4 times of their median employee remunerations. SEBI REGULATIONS REQUIRE COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE REMUNERATIONSÂ  While the rules do not put any restrictions on the companies regarding how much more they want to pay their top executives vis-a-vis an average employee, the Sebi regulations require most listed companies to annually disclose various remuneration ratios to help the investors know about salary practices at the firms in which they have invested. However, salaries of top executives, especially in case of those related to promoter groups, typically require the approval of the companies boards, various committees and shareholders. Besides, the companies with inadequate profits need the governments approval for any excessive salaries paid to their top executives. As per the rules, the remuneration payable to any one managing director or whole-time director or manager, cannot exceed 5 per cent of the net profit of the company. If there is more than one such director, the remuneration cannot exceed 10 per cent of the net profit to all such directors and managers taken together. INCREASE IN RATIO OF TOP EXECUTIVE PAYÂ Among the 30 Sensex firms, at least 15 have already disclosed an increase in the ratio of top executive pay with that of the median employee remuneration for 2016-17. Nine of the Sensex firms are yet to disclose these numbers and therefore the tally may go up. Six Sensex companies have reported some decline in this ratio and these include Wipro (down from 260 times to 259 times), Infosys (283 times), Dr Reddys Lab (from 312 times to 233 times) and Hero MotoCorp (from 755 times to 731 times). The countrys most-valued firm Reliance Industries did not disclose this ratio in its latest annual report published on the website. While its chief Mukesh Ambani has capped his pay at Rs 15 crore for many years now, the ratio was high at 205 times in 2014-15. Among other major Sensex firms, TCS saw the ratio between top-paid executive pay and the median employee remuneration rise to 515 times (from 460 times in previous year), while the same for Lupin stood at 1,263-times (though down from 1,317 times) for Chairman. The ratio for the CEO at Lupin was much lower at 217-times. At Adani Ports, the ratio was down to 42 times in case of Gautam Adani (from 48 times), while the ratio was much higher at 169-times for another Whole Time Director. The same for Bajaj Auto was also high at 522 times. Among banks, the ratio was highest for HDFC Banks CEO Aditya Puri (whose pay package rose by 20 per cent to over Rs 10 crore) where it rose from 179 to 187 times. Kotak Mahindra Bank saw the ratio rise from 42 to 48, ICICI from 100 to 112- times and Axis Bank from 72-times to 78-times. At HDFC Ltd, the ratio for the CEO Keki Mistry rose from 88 times to 92 times, while the same for Chairman Deepak Parekh was much less at 17 times. Among the companies which are yet to report their latest numbers, Larsen and Toubro had disclosed a very high ratio of 1004-times for the fiscal 2005-16. At ITC, the ratio rose from 427 to 508 times in case of Y C Deveshwar, who has now given up his top executive role, but the ratio for the current executive chief was much lesser at 59 times. Deveshwars total package rose by 58 per cent to Rs 21.16 crore, including all the benefits. Other companies that saw an increase in the ratio included Bharti Airtel (to 366-times in 2016-17), Cipla (416 times), M&M (108 times), Tata Steel (94 times) and HUL (138 times). In terms of the median employee remuneration, a few companies such as Wipro and Cipla recorded a decline and there was only a marginal rise of less than 5 per cent for several others such as Bharti Airtel, M&M, Bajaj Auto, TCS and HUL. The companies with an increase of over 10 per cent for median employee remuneration were a few and included Kotak Mahindra Bank, Adani Ports, HDFC Bank, HDFC Ltd and Lupin. Dr Reddys Lab was among the very few to see a decline in the CEO pay, while it was unchanged for RIL and Adani Ports. The companies having seen a rise in the top executive pay included Wipro, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tata Steel, M&M, Hero Motocorp, Lupin and Bharti Airtel. The overall key management pay rose significantly for Bharti Airtel, HDFC Bank, HDFC Ltd, TCS and Asian Paints. Â ALSO READ:"

"As many as five localities in Central Delhi, including Jor Bagh and Pandara Park, will be made zero-waste colonies by 2018, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) Chairman Naresh Kumar announced on Friday. ""The stress will be on segregation of waste at source, composting of organic waste and recycling so that minimum possible garbage reaches landfill sites,"" Kumar said.","Summarise: Five NDMC localities ? Jor Bagh, Pandara Park, Bapa Nagar, Kaka Nagar and Golf Links ? will be made zero waste colonies, the civic corporation?s chairman Naresh Kumar announced on Friday while presenting its annual budget of 2017-18.?This will be done in collaboration with local resident welfare associations. The stress will be on segregation of waste at source, composting of organic waste and recycling so that minimum possible garbage reaches landfill sites. We are working out the details. In a month or so, work will start on the ground,? Kumar told HT on Friday.In a zero waste colony, garbage is segregated into wet waste, dry waste and e-waste. Wet waste is then put in compost pits and e-waste sent to a recycle centre. The rag pickers will collect all the recyclable items from dry waste and the rest will go to the landfill site. This kind of waste segregation reduces the burden on landfill sites.Experts say that 50% of the garbage generated in a city is green waste that can be turned into compost. Another 30% can be recycled and only 20% should reach the landfills ideally.In some corners of the city ? in places like Dwarka, Defence Colony, Sarita Vihar, Preet Vihar and Dilshad Garden ? residents have already taken up composting in their community parks and have been segregating their domestic waste.The NDMC has also selected a concessionaire for scientific collection and disposal of construction and demolition waste through vehicles having radio frequency identification tags. ?The red colour bins were chosen to differentiate them from normal ones. We will install 10 bins with 10 tonne capacity and 20 with 5 tonne capacity. A concessionaire, Metro Waste Handling Limited, is removing the demolition waste from these bins and taking them to the Shashtri Park construction and demolition plant,? an official said.Delhi generates 5,000 tonnes of construction and demolition debris ? 40% of the total municipal waste - every day. Nearly half of this waste, from big and small construction sites, can be recycled but end up on the Yamuna riverbed, in our backyards, local water bodies, or at landfill sites.To boost mechanised sweeping, three more mechanical sweepers will be hired by the council.

Ramesh Mane was out on a trip with his friends, who while coming back realised Mane was missing. His friends said they were surprised on finding that Mane did not have major injuries.","Summarise: A 40-year-old person from the city was rescued a day after he fell into a 150-feet gorge at Madhe ghat in Velha taluka. He was on a trip with his friends on Sunday.Ramesh Mane, an employee of Thermax India Ltd, had gone with his group of 8-10 friends to Madhe Ghat, famous for scenic waterfall, in Velha taluka. While coming back, his friends realised that Mane was not with them, prompting a search for him. The search operation however had to be stalled due to heavy rainfall and thick fog.Â After realising that Mane had gone missing, his friends informed others including Thermax workers union president who in turn asked his friend Sachin Gaikwad  for help. According to his friends, Mane had to spend the entire night in the deep gorge while clinging on to a tree branch. Â ?They were shocked, frightened and were totally clueless. I told them to contact Velha police station and register a complaint and meanwhile, I called my friend Sachin Gaikwad who is known for rescue missions. He immediately responded and reached Velha in the middle of the night,? said Dinesh Dakhave, Thermax workers union president.Â Gaikwad and his team reached Velha early Monday morning. ?We made two teams and started search operation in every direction of the plateau. As we climbed down the ghat, we spotted Mane in a deep gorge. He was clinging to a nearby branch and was moving abruptly. There was no way to find out whether he was dead or alive. We shouted and whistled to which he responded after several minutes,? said Gaikwad, who works for Dadoji Kondev Bouldering Gym in Kondhwa.Â The rescue team realised that they were short in man power, as Mane was stuck in an inaccessible spot and it was not easy to pull him out to safe area. So, Gaikwad walked back to the village and contacted Shivdurg Mitra Pratishan of Lonavala and asked for technical help.Â Meanwhile, one of the rescuers managed to reach Mane, so the team acted swiftly and rather than waiting for the technical team, they brought Mane out with help from local villagers.Â ?We were surprised when we found out Mane was not majorly injured. However, he wasn?t able to walk properly as he had fallen down almost 150-feet. So we carried him to the village where their team was ready with the vehicle. He was admitted to a local hospital in Velha. I fear he had some internal bleeding, but was alive, that?s the main thing,? added Gaikwad."

"After US President Donald Trump barred its citizens from entering the US, Iran on Sunday said it would block entry for American citizens to the country until the US government withdraws its decision. Calling Trump's decision ""an open affront against the Iranian nation and Muslim world"", Iran said it will be recorded in history as ""a great gift to extremists"".","Summarise: Iran indicated it could bar entry to US citizens in response to a move by US President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order temporarily barring most arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Iran said Trump's wide-ranging order, which was signed on Friday, among other things, prevents most travelers from Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Yemen from entering the US, was insulting and that it would respond in kind while the restrictions are in place.Calling Trump's decision ""an open affront against the Iranian nation and the Muslim world"", the Iranian Foreign Ministry said the measure would backfire and promote more violence and extremism.

"The husband of former Doordarshan anchor Kanchan met CM Devendra Fadnavis, alleging that inaction by the BMC led to his wife's death after a tree fell on her. Fadnavis assured him that action has been initiated against the garden department of BMC. The BMC had reportedly earlier decided to prune the tree after an inspection, instead of cutting it down.

Accompanied by BJP leader Shaina NC, Nath met Fadnavis on Friday. He alleged inaction by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had led to Kanchan?s death and demanded a case be lodged against those responsible. Nath complained that in February this year, the owner of the plot had approached the BMC to cut the tree. The civic body inspected it and decided on pruning some of the branches of the dead tree instead of cutting it. The owner had even paid for the pruning, he said.

Fadnavis assured Nath and his family members, who accompanied him, that action has been initiated against the garden department of BMC. Kanchan, a former television news reader with Doordarshan, was on her way home from her yoga classes last Thursday when the tree fell on her, injuring her neck, at Kurla Road near Swastik Park at Chembur East. Nath was rushed to the hospital by vendors who were around at the time of the incident. She died three days later .Falling trees in the monsoon is one of the biggest hazards in the city.

The BMC, in its pre-monsoon activity, had undertaken an exercise to prune 60,000 trees across the city."

Call it a ""political opinion,"" and he corrects you - ""It's my national opinion. My opinions are about my country. They are not representative of any political ideology. It's a very cliched thing to call any opinion about the country a political opinion.""Many people believe that actors should stay away from talking about anything unrelated to films. In fact, if an actor has an opinion, especially one that is not popular, they get trolled. Kher tells IndiaToday.in, in an exclusive interview, ""Acting is a part of my life, it's not my life. I'm an individual; I'm a citizen of this country, I'm a teacher, I'm a motivational speaker, I'm a writer, I'm a son. Just because everyone may not agree with me, doesn't mean I'll stop putting forth what I want to say. In life, you cannot make everyone happy. And you don't necessarily stop talking to those who don't agree with you. You have to, as a celebrity, learn the art of ignoring. Yes, of course, you get upset and unhappy sometimes. But it's alright, I have been in this business for a long time.""While B-Towners from Shah Rukh Khan to Aamir Khan had expressed their concern that India was becoming increasingly intolerant, Anupam Kher had begged to differ. But when Sanjay Leela Bhansali is thrashed and his Padmavati sets are attacked for allegedly distorting the glorious Rajput history, does it not smack of intolerance? The actor says that ""it is very unfortunate,"" but not does think intolerance is the reason.""I think the media gives it great importance. The problem is that if a bunch of 10 people doing something like this gets nationally covered, then they know that this is how they will get noticed... But on a level of what they have done, it's absolutely not right. It should not have happened. Nobody can dictate what should be made and what should not be made,"" he emphasises.Anupam Kher, who was the censor chief from 2003-04, also said that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) rules need to be revisited. ""The rules were written in 1952. The present government had appointed a committee headed by Shyam Benegal. I don't know what happened to the recommendations. They need to be implemented.

In Hollywood, women are taking up this whole question of equality and I think that?s fantastic, so why can?t Bollywood take its cue from them??One thing is for sure that nobody is going to put that on a plate for you.

The data revealed that a total of 4,241 complaints were filed between these years. However, the conviction rate stood at 0.37% with only 16 cases reaching the punishment stage.","Summarise: In a decade to 2016, the incidents of molestation (under Section 354) reported in Bengaluru increased more than four-fold, statistics compiled by the city's Commissioner of Police show. Yet, according to our analysis of police data, of the 4,241 complaints filed between 2006 and 2016, the conviction rate was 0.37 per cent (16 cases).The number of complaints under under Section 354 (assault to outrage the modesty of a woman) rose from 150 in 2006 to 776 in 2016. Experts say this could be because of an increase in the number of incidents as well as greater willingness on the part of women to register complaints.This data project could serve as a template for how police in India's burgeoning cities can make sense of their crime data in public interest.Section 354 includes sexual harassment (354A), use of criminal force with intent to disrobe (354B), voyeurism (354C) and stalking (354D). The data obtained from the Bengaluru commissionerate group these offences under ""molestation"".MOLESTATION CASES SHOCK NATIONBengaluru entered 2017 with reports of mass molestation of women in the city's bustling MG Road and Brigade Road areas despite deployment of thousands of police personnel. The reports came as a shock to residents and for people across the country who believed the city to be safe for women.Kavya S., 24, was on her way to work when a stranger attacked her in public. ""It was around 8:30 am in broad daylight, I was walking to work in Kormangala when a stranger grabbed me and tried to kiss me in front of dozens of people! No one came to my help but when I screamed and kicked him, they yelled at me and asked me to leave him,"" she recounted.Kavya immediately filed a complaint with the local police under Section 354, but did not pursue the case once she shifted her residence. ""Police officials were very cooperative,"" she recalled, ""but I couldn't follow up on the case as I had to shift my house and job.""Cases such as Kavya's are increasingly common, although Bengaluru police say they are working to improve the law and order situation for women. ""We have identified areas that are hotspots for crimes against women and launched 51 Pink Hoysalas (mobile units) that are dedicated to women. We have also launched an app called 'Suraksha' last week (April second week). Anyone can inform us if they are in danger and we would reach the spot in 10 minutes,"" S. Ravi, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime), told IndiaSpend.JUSTICE DELAYEDBengaluru's criminal justice system is marred by delays, as with the rest of India's. Of the 4,241 molestation cases reported, 2,248 (53 per cent) are pending trial, according to data from the Bengaluru City Police Commissionerate.Among the cases tried, there have been 523 acquittals (12 per cent) and 16 convictions (0.37 per cent) -- even as the police consider 97 per cent of cases to be ""true"" after investigation. A decade earlier, the figure for ""true"" cases was 84 per cent, indicating more open-mindedness in dealing with women's complaints as well as better effort on the police's part to investigate.However, lawyers and activists believe the large proportion of acquittals is due to shoddy investigation. ""In most crime against women cases, especially the molestation cases, the accused get acquitted or the cases are kept pending for years,"" Pramila Nesargi, a noted lawyer and a well-known women's rights activist, said. ""The main reason for all these is the reluctance of police in getting proper evidence.""Bengaluru's conviction rate for molestation is indicative of the larger problem nationwide. ""Few women who survive sexual assault have a pathway to justice and recovery from their horror,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy, in a statement.The government needs to think from women's perspective, Rani Shetty, coordinator of Vanitha Sahayavani, a government agency that provides rescue and support services for women in distress, and operates from the office of the Commissioner of Police, told IndiaSpend. ""I have met many victims of molestation whose cases have been pending for years. The legal system needs to be strong, there should be fast-track judgment for any cases related to women,"" she said.As per law, the police have to file a chargesheet within 90 days of a crime being reported. ""[I]n most cases, they fail to do so, and this in turn affects the court proceedings,"" Ugrappa V.S., a member of the Karnataka Legislative Council and chairperson of the expert committee to prevent crimes against women and children, told IndiaSpend.THE DANGER OF DELAYSJudicial delays, which make it easy for the accused to get bail, can be extremely dangerous for victims of sexual assault. In one case, a Grade IX student was molested by her 25-year-old neighbour. Her family filed a Section 354 case at the Peenya police station and the accused was arrested immediately. On his release on bail within four months, he kidnapped the girl and raped her. He is back in jail now.""What happened to me shouldn't happen to any girl. He has to be punished,"" the girl told IndiaSpend.""If the police had taken strict action on his first crime, they could have prevented the second incident. Now he is in jail but he might do the same thing when he comes out,"" her father said.The city's burgeoning population, with a massive influx of immigrants, could be one of the factors behind molestation cases such as the one that took place on New Year's eve, former Lokayukta Justice (Retd) N. Santosh Hegde said speaking at a private college in the city in March 2017. The 2011 census had pegged Bangalore city's population at 84.4 lakh. By 2016, it had risen to more than 1.15 crore.""They come alone. They stay alone. And the manly desire is always there,"" he said at the discussion about immigrants, adding that the benefit of anonymity in an overcrowded city apparently emboldens them to pursue their pervert desires. He also cited a lack of morals as one of the reasons.By Elizabeth Mani for IndiaSpend.org"

It's not easy to do what you want...when you are financially dependant on the other person.""","Summarise: Veteran actor Ratna Pathak Shah, who will soon be seen in the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, has said the patriarchal structure anywhere in the world is hard not just on women but on men too.

						?How many men have a choice? How many men are doing a job that they did not want to do, doing things and behaving in ways that they did not want to,? Ratna, who will be essaying the role of a 55-year-old widow in the film, said.?Patriarchy is hard on men as well as women. So we need to get rid of the root cause of it. Get rid of this idea of patriarchy and find new ways of looking at society,? said the acclaimed actress, who is married to Naseeruddin Shah.She questioned, ?A number of times women ask for permission from the men in their lives to do something or other. Aren?t we asking for such a behaviour then? When a woman asks for a permission from someone, yes, we are asking for it... But then you have to gauge the situation and circumstances as well. There are instances that force a woman to ask for permission. It?s not easy to do what you want to do when you are financially dependant on the other person... Within a family, since childhood you are being told that you are not really welcome, a lot of girls face it... I have faced it too. But I never got stopped due to this. When a woman wants something, she doesn?t stop,? Ratna said.Lipstick Under My Burkha, which is about four women characters, will see Ratna essaying the role of a woman whose sexual longings awaken at the age of 55.Asked if the scenes where she had to show those urges in the film, made her uncomfortable or think twice about it, she said: ?It?s not like it did not occur to me as to how a few people in my family would react to my role in the film. I did think on what my answer should be if I am questioned about my role. But now I have those answers. Because I know that there are certain topics in our lives that we don?t talk about or dodge. We don?t talk about homosexuality, generation gap... There are many issues that we rarely talk about. There are some people who are educating themselves and learning, but there are people who are still struggling on those lines. But then that is how a society works. Everyone cannot think the same. Some move forward, some lag behind,? the 60-year-old said.Talking about the men in the film, Ratna hailed the ?male gaze? on the sets. ?There is a big change in the country. There is no doubt about it. The male gaze on the set without exception was unusual... I have no second thoughts on that. I have been on a lot of film sets before, so I know what kind of vibes go around. So, this was truly unusual. And in a film like this, where there was a possibility that at some point or situation there could have been a crooked man, but no, there wasn?t a single one,? she said.The actress also said that India is in dire need of sex education. ?India is in need of sex education. We don?t know how we became a billion... ?Woh toh bas bhagwaan ki daya se hogaya?. We desperately need some information, which is why Alankrita Shrivastava made this film, so that people get this information in one go -- so that our population grows from a billion to 10 billion perhaps,? quipped the actress.Lipstick Under My Burkha, releasing on July 21, was in the news after the censor board deemed it too ?lady oriented? to release.

"Delhi was officially announced as the capital of British Raj by the then-Emperor George V, on December 12, 1911. The capital was shifted from Calcutta as Delhi was the financial and political seat of many earlier empires and was located closer to the geographical center of India. The rising nationalist movement in Calcutta was also responsible for the shift.","Summarise: It was on this day, 100 years ago, that an event changed the course of Delhi's history forever. The Delhi Durbar on December 12, 1911 was marked as a celebration of the coronation of King Emperor George V. Delhi had witnessed two such durbars before, in 1877 and 1903, but the Delhi Durbar of 1911 assumed unusual importance as King George V announced the shifting of British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi.As chronicled by HT over the past year in the series New Delhi 100, Delhi in 1911 was just a small town in the Punjab province, still recovering from the wounds inflicted on it by the British regime after the uprising of 1857. But the king's proclamation at the durbar, kept a secret till then, changed Delhi's fate and put it firmly on the international political map.Calcutta, the nerve centre of British Raj till then, had fallen out of favour as it had become politically volatile. The British government wanted to shift the capital and Delhi won on many counts. It was closer to Shimla, the summer capital and was well connected by rail.In the next 20 years, New Delhi would be carved out of scattered villages and a rocky ridge inhabited by jackals. The new capital and its imposing buildings would come to define Delhi for the next 100 years. The capital, however, would keep growing beyond the garden city planned by Edwin Lutyens - and continues to grow."
The United States Justice Department has said that Boston-based construction firm CDM Smith allegedly paid more than ?6 crore as bribes from 2011 to 2015 to National Highway Authority of India officials for contracts. The investigation was closed by the Justice Department after the firm agreed to give up the money it earned as profits due to the bribes. nn,"Summarise: A Boston-based construction engineering firm allegedly paid USD 1.18 million bribe to officials of the National Highway Authority of India between 2011 and 2015 to bag contracts, the US Justice Department has said, prompting the Indian government to order a probe into the allegations.The Criminal Division of the Justice Department, in a letter dated June 21, said CDM Smith through its employees and agents, and those of its wholly-owned subsidiary in India (CDM India) paid approximately USD 1.18 million in bribes to government officials in India in exchange for highway construction supervision and design contracts and a water project contract resulting in approximately USD four million in net profits.Between 2011 and 2015, employees of CDM Smith?s division responsible for India operations and CDM India illegally paid bribes to NHAI officials in order to receive contracts from them, the Justice Department said in the letter to CDM Smith.?The bribes generally were two-four per cent of the contract price and paid through fraudulent subcontractors, who provided no actual services and understood that payments were meant to solely benefit the officials,? it said.In addition, CDM Smith?s division responsible for India and CDM India paid USD 25,000 to local officials in Goa in relation to a water project contract, the Justice Department said.?All senior management at CDM India (who also acted as employees and agents of CDM Smith and signed contracts on behalf of CDM Smith, including CDM India?s country manager) were aware of the bribes for CDM Smith and CDM India contracts, and approved or participated in the misconduct,? it said.Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari has taken a serious note of the allegations and asked the NHAI Chairman to hold an inquiry into the matter, a senior Ministry official said in New Delhi.The investigations into the bribery allegations by the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice has now been closed after CDM Smith agreed to disgorge USD 4 million, which the Boston-company earned as profit due to the bribery.The Justice Department said it has decided to close the investigation in this regard.The final fourth instalment of the disgorged money would be paid by CDM Smith by October 1, 2017.As per the agreement, CDM Smith agreed that it would not seek a tax deduction for the USD 4 million it was required to disgorge.?CDM Smith has a clear Code of Ethics and core values that drive our behaviour every day,? CDM Smith CEO Stephen J Hickox said in a statement.?Any breach of these values or improper business activities is counter to our culture and will not be tolerated,? Hickox said.Meahwhile, CDM Smith has also been sanctioned by the World Bank for failing to disclose a subcontract on a project in Vietnam.The company and its affiliates have been conditionally non-debarred for one and half years.?When executing a consulting contract financed by the Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, CDM Smith failed to disclose a sub-consulting agreement with a local Vietnamese company, and did not seek a contractually-required written approval of the agreement from the Project implementing agency,? the bank said.CDM Smith said it has expanded its Ethics and Compliance programme, including appointing its first Chief Compliance Officer, to ensure all employees fully understand their role in compliance, and has established channels for reporting any compliance-related concerns.?The employees associated with these improper business activities were separated from the company following the early findings of CDM Smith?s internal investigations,? the company said.

"Late actor Raj Kapoor's 'Mera Naam Joker' and 'Sangam' will be the last two films to be shown at Delhi's 84-year-old Regal cinema hall that will shut down on March 31. The cinema hall, which is located in Connaught Place, was said to be a favourite of Raj Kapoor. The building will be converted into a multiplex soon.","Summarise: Raj Kapoor?s Mera Naam Joker and Sangam will be the last two movies to be shown at Delhi?s 85-year-old Regal cinema hall that is closing down on March 30.One of the owners of the hall, Vishal Choudhary, said that he received many requests and fan mails requesting them to screen Raj Kapoor?s movies as the hall was his favourite. He is said to have visited the theatre regularly and hosted premieres of several films released under the banner of RK films, including Sangam that released in 1964 and Mera Naam Joker, first screened in 1970.The hall that is currently playing Anushka Sharma-starrer Phillauri will show Mera Naam Joker  in the evening at six and Sangam at 9pm on Thursday.Regal Cinema in Connaught Place was the first theatre in the area opened in 1932 by Sir Sobha Singh.Called the New Delhi Premier Theatre in its early days, Regal may return as a multiplex with four auditoria. According to the owners, they are trying to get permission from agencies concerned to build a multiplex at the same spot.?The facade will not be changed as the building is a heritage structure but inside there will be major changes including a new design of the hall, better seats, new toilets and canteen,? said Choudhary.The corridors and the staircase of the hall is lined with black and white photographs of actors Dev Anand, Meena Kumari, Nargis, and Raj Kapoor.?Raj Kapoor and Nargis would spend time a lot of time here. Kapoor often sat through the premieres of his films. The theatre was decorated and rituals were performed before the start of every film. Every show then was house full in advance for at least a week,? said Roop Ghai, manager.Choudhary said he has got 60% of the proposal to build a multiplex cleared. ?We have got the no-objection certificate from fire department and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as it is a heritage site. Our designs have been approved by Delhi Urban Arts Commission,? he told Hindustan Times.?It will, however, take at least a year before the work begins as we have to take permission from several other departments and it takes a long time to complete these things,? he said. Hindustan Times had reported on December 22 that the cinema was on the verge of closing due to severe cash crunch aggravated by demonetisation.Choudhary said it was time to fold up Regal as they had not been making money for many years now. ?Business has been down for a decade and last month?s collection of Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya film was also not very good.? He said the cinema hall has been unable to recover operating costs over the past two years. ?Half the money we get from tickets goes to the distributor. It costs us over Rs 2 lakh a week to run a show.?Choudhary also said that they didn?t want to take any chances after the collapse of some buildings in Connaught Place recently. The New Delhi Municipal Council has asked the owners of buildings in the area to prove structural capability. This is another reason why he decided to close the theatre and rebuild it.The first and second floors of the Regal Building were sold to Madame Tussauds in 1996, so the famed wax museum could open its 22nd branch in Delhi. The ground floor remains with the owner."
A 32-year-old Delhi woman strangulated her husband and reportedly slept next to his dead body in her one-room house for two nights. The man used to reportedly thrash his wife after consuming alcohol heavily. The woman bought alcohol and made her husband drink during the weekend calling it a treat from her side and murdered him when he passed out. ,"Summarise: A woman in southwest Delhi?s Kapashera planned the perfect murder of her ?abusive? husband and almost got away with it too, but for the sharp eye of a police informer who spotted injuries on the body minutes before it was cremated.The woman, Shilpi Adhikari, 32, police said, killed her husband but did not know what to do with the body after the murder.She slept beside it for two nights inside her one-room house in Kapashera. On the third day, she informed her neighbours and tried to pass the incident off as natural death. She almost managed to get away with it too but for a police informer, who noticed strangulation marks on the man?s neck minutes before the body was to be cremated and informed the police. The police on Tuesday arrested Shilpi and registered a case of murder. Shilpi Adhikari, a native of West Bengal, worked as a housekeeping employee at the Royal Bank of Scotland. She waited for the weekend to execute her plan, when her husband Nitish usually drank heavily and thrashed her. It had to be done on a Saturday. She had waited the whole week.  According to investigating officials, on Saturday evening after dinner, she offered Nitish alcohol. She had bought extra alcohol for her husband from a local shop near her house. ?She told her husband that it was her treat and continued giving him alcohol till late in the night,? an investigating officer said. Read: ?He beat me for hours?: Delhi woman who smothered husband says he left no choice?At around midnight, when her husband passed out she strangulated him. Unsure about what to do next, she continued to sleep in the same 8x10 feet room with the body,? the officer said. For more than 48 hours, Shilpi did not step out. On Monday morning, at around 9 am, locals in the Kapashera village heard Shilpi crying outside her house. She was wailing loudly, a villagers later told the police. She told locals that her husband had suffered a heart attack and died in his sleep. Nobody suspected her. The couple had two kids, aged 13 and 11, who live with their maternal grandmother in West Bengal. According to police, the locals, mostly migrants from West Bengal and Bihar, advised that the body be cremated as it had started smelling because of the heat on Monday as the day temperature was around 37Â°C. By noon, the locals reached the crematorium along with the body. Shilpi was there too. An officer said Nitish?s body was on a pyre, when a police informer noticed some marks on Nitish?s body and also realised that the smell emanating from the body wasn?t normal. He secretly called inspector Ashish Dalal, posted at the Kapashera police station. Dalal and his team immediately rushed to the crematorium and stopped the locals from cremating the body. ?Had we been 10-15 minutes late, the body would have reduced to ashes. There would be no evidence and it would have been a perfect murder. We took the body and sent it for post mortem,? an officer told the Hindustan Times.Doctors told the police on Tuesday morning that the man had died of strangulation more than 72 hours before the body was brought for post mortem. Shilpi, who was detained from the spot, was formally arrested. Nitish, according to Shilpi?s confession was an abusive drinker who thrashed her mercilessly. The beatings, like his drinking, had increased over the last few months leaving her with no option but to murder him."
"After the Supreme Court made it mandatory to play the National Anthem in all cinema halls, a petition by an apex court lawyer has demanded ""equal respect and status"" for National Song Vande Mataram. ""On January 24, 1950, Jana Gana Mana and Vande Mataram both songs were adopted of equal honour with each other and equal status,"" said the petitioner. n","Summarise: Even before the row over the order asking cine-goers to stand up before a movie for the National Anthem died down, the Supreme Court Tuesday admitted a plea which said ""equal respect and status"" should be given to National Song Vande Mataram too. ""Constituent Assembly of India was empowered by Jawaharlal Nehru in August 25, 1948 by making a statement to alter the words or choose entirely a new song but unfortunately it could not be done and on January 24, 1950 Jana Gana Mana and Vande Mataram both songs were adopted of equal honour with each other and equal status,"" said the petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Sanjeev Bhatnagar. This was one of the several intervention applications filed by people who opposed to the November 30 order which made it mandatory for all cinema theatres across the country to play the National Anthem during which it was made compulsory for the public to show respect by standing up. One of the petition even termed the order ""popocorn nationalism"". Also read: Handwara encounter: Army major succumbs to injuries Significantly, the court on Tuesday clarified that the audience need not stand when the National Anthem is played as a part of the storyline of a film, a newsreel or a documentary. Agreeing to hear all the plea together on April 18, Justice Misra made it categorical to Bhatnagar that he will not be allowed to delve too much into history and should restrict himself only to legal debate on the issue. ""We cannot get into all that. Yes, you have made some good research. But there is a lot of difference between intellectual curiosity and legal debate. You have to draw a distinction between the two. Remember, we have only one National Anthem and do not propagate theories here,"" SC told Bhatnagar. Also Read: Bihar: Clamour grows within RJD for Tejaswi as CM, Lalu says he is the future This was after Bhatnagar argued that a decision on equal respect to anthem and National Song required an intervention by the SC because ""clearly the role of Vande Mataram has been referred by the Constituent Assembly as it has played a historic part in the struggle in the Indian Freedom"".

"The local airport in Cristiano Ronaldo's native Madeira Islands in Portugal was named after the 32-year-old Real Madrid forward on Wednesday. The Real Madrid striker was joined by Portugal's President and the Prime Minister, who unveiled a commemorative plaque outside the terminal entrance, above a bust of Ronaldo. The airport has been renamed to Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo.","Summarise: Cristiano Ronaldo now has an international airport named after him. The Real Madrid striker was joined on Wednesday by dozens of guests and hundreds of fans in his native Madeira Islands for an official ceremony renaming the local airport as Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo.Portugal?s president and the prime minister flew to the island and unveiled a commemorative plaque outside the terminal entrance, above a bust of Ronaldo.The 32-year-old Ronaldo is a local hero in Madeira, where he is seen as a rags-to-riches success. He already has a statue, a museum and a hotel named after him in Madeira. ?You know how proud I am of my roots, my homeland,? Ronaldo, wearing a dark suit and tie, said in a speech.The four-time player of the year has made a record 138 national team appearances for Portugal and is the team?s top scorer with 71 goals.The change was decided by the Madeira regional government after Portugal won the 2016 European Championship. Critics said a more distinguished historical figure would be more appropriate. Petitions were started for and against the change.Ronaldo acknowledged that it was rare for a public figure to be honoured while still alive, saying he was aware that some people didn?t agree with the name change. However, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the tribute was legitimate because it was decided by an elected government.Ronaldo, Rebelo de Sousa said in his speech, is ?an example of excellence? and ?projects Madeira and Portugal across the world far more than anybody else.?Ronaldo is not the first football player with his name on an airport. In Northern Ireland, an airport was renamed George Best Belfast City Airport in 2006, a year after the local player and former Manchester United winger died.In Funchal, the regional government provided transport to the outdoor ceremony for schoolchildren and elderly people at care homes. Also present were players and officials from the local Andorinha soccer club, where Ronaldo started when he was seven years old.Tourism is the economic mainstay of Madeira, which lies about 500km (310 miles) off the north-west coast of Africa. About 2.5 million passengers use the airport annually. The terminal is a low, two-story building next to an oceanside runway where landings are famous for sometimes being hairy because of crosswinds."

"The Election Commission (EC) barred voters from carrying their personal pens inside the voting chambers while casting their vote in the Presidential Election on Monday.

Since it is a secret ballot, the voters should not disclose whom they have voted for.Green-coloured ballot papers will be there for members of Parliament and pink for MLAs who vote in the election.The value of an MLA?s vote depends on the population of the state he or she represents. But the value of the vote of an MP does not vary -- it is 708.Hence, the different colour of ballot papers will help the returning officer count the votes based on the value. The total value of the electoral college is 10,98,903.The ballot boxes will be brought to Delhi for counting on July 20.The electoral college, which elects the President through the system of proportional representation, comprises elected MPs and members of state legislative assemblies -- a total of 4,896 voters including 4,120 MLAs and 776 elected MPs.While 233 are elected members of the Rajya Sabha, 543 are from the Lok Sabha.A total of 32 polling stations -- one in Parliament House and one each in the state legislative assemblies, have been set up.33 observers have been appointed by the EC to oversee the conduct of election.

After some activists spoke against dressing up the penguin, the zoo authorities clarified that the penguin wore the shirt just ""for a few seconds"".","Summarise: Mr. Molt, one of eight Humboldt penguins brought to the Byculla zoo from South Korea, turned 2 on Friday.

						Eight penguins arrived at the Byculla zoo in July last year. One of them, Dory, died. But ever since the zoo opened the penguin enclosure, the seven others ? Bubble, Mr Molt, Flipper, Donald, Daisy, Popeye and Olive, have stolen hearts. Mr. Molt is the youngest of the seven penguins in the Byculla zoo. All others are aged between 2 and 3 years.

						The Humboldt penguin is a south American species found in the cold climate of coastal Peru and Chile. They were all named after famous Disney characters, based on their behaviour. Bubble is the naughtiest and does not let the others eat before she does, and birthday boy Mr Molt, the youngest male, is the most playful of the lot, said zoo officials. Dr. Madhumita Kale gives Mr Molt a check-up on his birthday on Friday.

						Dr Madhumita Kale, the veterinarian in charge of the penguins, said Mr. Molt got his name because he was molting (shedding his skin, which regenerates on its own every year) when he was brought to the zoo. The oldest penguin, Flipper, is the most dominant and is very protective of her family, said caretakers. Donald and Daisy and Popeye and Olive, were obvious couples and were named so. City-based activists, however, were irked when they got to know Mr Molt was made to wear a t-shirt. ?While activists have been repeatedly telling Mumbai pet owners not to put clothes on dogs as it raises their body temperature, here we have specialists from the civic body torturing penguins like this,? said Anand Siva, animal welfare activist from Chembur. ?By putting a shirt on its body, the body temperature is being trapped and since these birds are kept in a cool climate, they can suffocate.?Zoo authorities said the penguin was made to wear the shirt for just a few seconds. ?It was done under proper supervision of the doctor. It was for a few seconds and removed after that. All the penguins are healthy. We know the rules and the systems to take care of them,? said Dr Sanjay Tripathi, Byculla Zoo director. Humboldt quick factsWhat do they eat? They were first fed fish such as Bombay duck and eel. But they also eat mackerel, anchovies and sardinesWhat do the vets wear? Full lab coats, gum boots, face masks and head caps, mostly to prevent infecting the penguins or catching infections from themWhere do they come from?

"Attorney General KK Venugopal on behalf of the Centre said in the Supreme Court, ""Privacy is part of Right to Life, but does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right."" He added, ""Since right to privacy consists of diverse aspects and it is a sub-specie of liberty, every aspect of the sub-species will not qualify as a fundamental right."" ","Summarise: Arguing in the right to privacy case before the nine-judge Constitution bench in Supreme Court today, Attorney General K K Venugopal said that privacy does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right. ""Privacy is part of Right to Life under Article 21, but does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right,"" said AG Venugopal on behalf of the Centre. The debate on privacy as a fundamental right is a part of the larger debate on Aadhaar and if the scheme violates one's right to privacy.The Centre has earlier said that petitions challenging the validity of Aadhaar over violation of privacy cannot be entertained under Article 21. ATTORNEY GENERAL MOUNTS DEFENCEArguing for the Centre, AG Venugopal said that framers of the Constitution intentionally omitted mention of privacy as a fundamental right. There are several aspects to Right to Life such as right to food, shelter and employment but everything does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right, said K K Venugopal in the Supreme Court today. The Attorney General said that there is no absolute Right to Life and deprivation of the right in certain instances is in-built in the Constitution. He said that while life and liberty are qualified rights under the Constitution but their every aspect is not a fundamental right and it cannot be elevated to that status. Petitioners want privacy on a whole to be declared as a fundamental right but it will have grave consequences, argued Attorney General Venugopal. He said that a World Bank report has identified Aadhaar as a great scheme for developing countries.THREE STATES SUPPORT PETITIONERSKapil Sibal, appearing for the states Karnataka, West Bengal and Puducherry, told the nine-judge bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khekar that the states support the petitioners on the argument that privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Kapil Sibal said that while privacy is not mentioned in the Constitution of America and Australia but it is a fundamental right. WHAT HAVE THE PETITIONED SAIDSenior counsel Gopal Subramanium told the Supreme Court last Wednesday that the Preamble to the Constitution intrinsically guarantees the right. He said that liberty, which is fundamental to a democracy, cannot exist without privacy.Senior counsel Arvind Datar argued that right to privacy flows from Article 14 (Right to Equality), Article 19 (Freedom of Expression) and Article 21 (Right to Life). Arguing for privacy as a fundamental right, Dattar said that the court must not strictly lay the right to privacy under a single article. Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee , appearing in support of privacy right, said that even if the Constitution did not ""explicitly"" provide this right, it could be deduced as had been done in the case of freedom of press.WHAT HAS THE COURT SAID SO FARWhile hearing the petitioners, the Supreme Court observed that right to privacy cannot be absolute and the state may have powers to put reasonable curbs. The nine-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice J S Khekar, comprises Justices J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, Rohinton Fali Nariman, Abhay Manohar Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer. ""We live in an age of big data and the state is entitled to regulate the data whether it is for the purpose of regulating crime, taxation or other activities... Right to privacy cannot be so absolute that it prevents the state from legislating or regulating it,"" the Constitution bench said.The Supreme Court also observed that ignorance of citizens on how personal data furnished by them was being used could not be the basis for not testing the validity of a law, in this case the Aadhaar Act.(With inputs from Anusha Soni and agencies) ALSO READ:Aadhaar vs WhatsApp: How privacy changes meaning for government in different cases "

He is the eleventh accused in the case.The public prosecutor opposed the superstar?s bail application, stating that he could use his clout to influence witnesses and weaken the ongoing investigation. The prosecution also referred to an ongoing pro-Dileep social media campaign to secure his release.However, the embattled actor?s counsel ?

"IT services major Infosys became the first India-registered company to be listed on NASDAQ on March 11, 1999. Infosys Technologies was also the first Indian company to be added to the NASDAQ-100 index, which lists 100 largest non-financial stocks in terms of market capitalisation. NASDAQ is the second-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalisation.","Summarise: Infosys, the Bangalore-based software trailblazer, created history on March 11 by becoming the first Indian-registered company to list on Nasdaq, one of the two major stock exchanges in the US.Technically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998. Now the doors are open and we could expect to see at least 10 Indian information technology (IT), pharmaceutical and telecom companies follow Infosys' example over the next two years. By global standards, however, India's presence on Nasdaq will be modest. Some 80 Israeli companies and a good number of companies from Australia, Argentina and South Africa are also on Nasdaq.Nasdaq itself was launched in 1971. Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. It is the popular perception that it is an exchange predominantly for IT companies, since its stars have been names like Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Netscape.Actually, less than 20 per cent of the listed companies are in the IT industry. The bulk are in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, banking, telecom, electronics, oil, transportation and housing. By and large, Nasdaq is home to new, first-generation, technology-driven companies. Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy. The fact that it is a professionally-owned, one-industry company of relatively new vintage helped. Over 80 per cent of its revenues are generated in North America.But a large majority of established, family-owned Indian companies will have to rework their accounts if they wish to seek listing in the US. The American standards are ruthless. In 1993, Daimler-Benz listed on the NYSE. Its reported profit of $370 million under German rules got converted into a $1 billion loss by American standards.This is not so in India. Second, unlike India, the US requires all deferred taxes to be recorded. Third, unlike the US, India allows excess depreciation and provides a choice to the company on the method to be adopted for calculating the depreciation charge.Fourth, unlike the US, the Indian standard recognises the revaluation of fixed assets. Fifth, US accounting standards require gains or losses from foreign currency transactions to be included in determining net income. There are other differences as well - for example, the US does not allow proposed dividend to be accrued and requires current portion of long-term debt to be shown as current liability.The London-based International Accounting Standards Committee, a private-sector body of which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is a member, has been pursuing the cause of core, uniform norms to be adopted around the globe.

The investigators also alleged before Justice I S Mehta that Bharti, former Law Minister, used to harass and beat his wife Lipika Mitra, who has sought cancellation of his bail in a domestic violence case lodged by her. The MLA, who was granted bail on October 7, 2015 after being in jail for eight days, has denied the allegations levelled against him by his wife. His counsel today told the court that they would like to file a rejoinder. The police, which has filed its affidavit following the courts direction, also submitted in the court orally that an ""AIIMS medical board has opined that the scars on the womans body were due to dog bites and burn injuries"". The investigators had on April 5 last year filed the charge sheet in the case, mentioning that the woman had made an allegation that Bharti had endangered the life of an unborn child which she was carrying by unleashing his dog on her. The police said ""the AIIMS medical board had examined six photos, which are concerned with the treatment history of dog bite, prescribed by Ayushman hospital (in Dwarka) here. ""We are also of the opinion that the scar marks could be due to consequences of dog bite injuries,"" the police said in its affidavit. It also claimed that some of the injury marks were ""due to burns."" In its affidavit, the police said ""Somnath Bharti used to harass, beat and abuse the petitioner (wife) from the very beginning of the marriage, despite having knowledge about her frail health conditions. ""The medical record produced by the petitioner (wife) was examined and verified and it shows that she was suffering from diabetes and hypertension at the time of pregnancy."" It claimed there was sufficient evidence on record for alleged offences for attempt to murder, act done with intent to prevent child being born alive or to cause it to die after birth, causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means against the MLA from Malviya Nagar assembly. Further, the police said there was a case of alleged dowry harassment and criminal breach of trust alongwith the charge of cheating and criminal intimidation against him under the Indian Penal Code. Lipika had moved the high court challenging the bail order, saying it was almost like a verdict and the trial court had relied on the case diary which allegedly should not have been done at that stage. Bhartis wife had on June 10, 2015 lodged a complaint against him with the Delhi Commission for Women and an FIR was lodged by the Delhi Police on September 9, 2015 for allegedly subjecting her to domestic violence and trying to kill her. The AAP leader was arrested in the wee hours of September 29, 2015 after the Supreme Court had ordered him to surrender but was granted bail on October 7, 2015. Police also informed the court that it has filed a charge sheet in the matter before the trial court, which has taken cognisance of the matter and posted it for hearing on May 20. Taking on record the affidavit filed by the police, the high court then posted the matter for hearing on October 24. The womans counsel Rahul Kumar urged the court to list the matter for early hearing saying it has already been delayed for over one year. "
"PM Narendra Modi will become the first foreign dignitary to have dinner at the White House with US President Donald Trump. Modi, who will arrive in Washington tonight on a three-day visit, will have a working dinner with Trump on Monday, after a one-on-one interaction followed by bilateral meetings. Modi is on a three-nation tour to USA, Portugal and Netherlands.","Summarise: By Lalit K Jha Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) Seeking to ""roll out a red- carpet welcome"" to the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, US President Donald Trump would host him for a working dinner at the White House on Monday, the first of its kind under this administration. ""The White House is very interested in making this a special visit. Were really seeking to roll out the red carpet. In fact, the two (leaders) will have dinner, a working dinner at the White House. This will be the first dinner for a foreign dignitary at the White House under this administration. So, we think thats very significant,"" a senior administration official told reporters at the White House on the eve of Modis arrival. Modi arrives in the US Capitol tonight on a three-day visit during which he would have a meeting with Trump at the White House. Beginning Monday afternoon, the two leaders would spend several hours together in various settings including one-o- one, delegation level, a reception and conclude with a working dinner. ""Theyll start off with a one-on-one meeting. Theyll go from the one-on-one meeting to the bilateral meetings. That will last for about an hour. Then they will each give press statements,"" the official, said clarifying that it would not be a press conference. ""Theyll move from the press statements to a cocktail reception. And that will be followed by the working dinner. So its a long interaction, lots of time for the two leaders to get to know each other, to interact on the critical issues that face our two countries,"" the official said. During the meetings, the American side would be represented by top leaders including the Vice President Mike Pence, the National Security Advisor, Lt. Gen. H R McMaster, and the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis, the Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The Modi trip, the official said is an opportunity to strengthen the US-India strategic partnership, which Trump very much views as a critical partnership in promoting stability and security in the Asia Pacific region and globally. ""We anticipate that their discussions will be broad- ranging, hitting on a variety of regional and global issues that would seek to advance our common priorities, including fighting terrorism, promoting economic growth and prosperity,"" the official added. Noting that the US is very much interested in facilitating Indias defence modernisation, and helping to enhance its role as a leader in the Asia Pacific, the official said the Trump Administration believes that a strong India is good for the US. ""Now, of course, weve seen rapid growth in the defence and security partnership over the last few years, and President Trump very much wants to build on that momentum. And last years designation of India as a major defence partner was extremely important, and I think well see a concrete expression of this important designation during this visit,"" said the senior White House official. The Trump Administration, the official said, believes that defence trade strengthens both the countries security, it reinforces the strategic partnership, and it allows their armed forces to cooperate more closely and improve their interaction with one another. Observing that this defence trade has supported thousands of American jobs, the official said since 2008, India has signed over USD 15 billion in defence contracts with the US. Counter-terrorism would be another major area of discussion. ""The US and India are both committed to combating all forms of terrorism and strengthening their cooperation in areas like terrorist screening, intelligence and information sharing, terrorists use of the Internet, and, of course, terrorist designations,"" the official said. ""I think we can expect to see some new initiatives on counter terrorism cooperation,"" the official said. Among other things, Modi and Trump will also be discussing global cooperation and things like burden-sharing. Mentioning that India has committed more than USD3 billion in development aid to Afghanistan, the official said the US views Indias role in Afghanistan as very positive in helping to stabilise the country and promote democracy there. Noting that India has also adopted UN sanctions against North Korea in April, the official said India joins the US in sending a very strong message to the North Korean regime. ""This visit will provide an opportunity for both countries to restate their commitment to common principles in the strategically vital important region of the Indo-Pacific. This includes freedom of navigation and overflight,"" the official asserted. In the trade and investment area, India and the US are committed to ""expanding and balancing"" their trade relationship, the official said. ""Right now, two-way trade in goods and services totals over USD 114 billion. Now, there are challenges in the trading sphere, and both sides look to increase their market access,"" the official added. Observing that the US is looking for things like stronger intellectual property protections, reductions in tariffs, the official said this visit offers an opportunity to advance that trade dialogue and look for opportunities that will enhance prosperity and create jobs for both countries. Energy partnership is one aspect of the economic relationship that has not been highlighted as much in the past, the official said, adding that this would be an important part of the trip. Indian energy companies have signed over USD 32 billion in long-term contracts for the export of US-produced liquefied natural gas, including from Louisiana and Maryland, he said. The visit will also demonstrate the strong people-to- people ties, the White House official said. Today, nearly four million Indian Americans are in the United States, and more than 166,000 Indian students are studying in the US, contributing USD 5 billion in economic activity and supporting an estimated 64,000 American jobs, the official said. Modis visit to the US ? the first under the Trump Administration -- offers an opportunity for relationship- building, the official said. "

"The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) has arrested 18 Indian fishermen and seized three boats near the International Maritime Border Line off the Gujarat coast, an official said on Sunday. This is the first such incident in April while 231 Indian fishermen were arrested and 40 boats seized by Pakistan authorities in March, the official added.","Summarise: The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) has apprehended 18 Indian fishermen and seized three boats off the Gujarat coast, an official said today.

"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border will need to be transparent so that people on the US side do not get hit by massive sacks of drugs being tossed over it. Trump earlier proposed attaching solar panels, saying the panels would provide cheap energy to pay for the wall.","Summarise: Donald Trump doesn?t see the need for a proposed border wall to stretch the length of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,218 km) frontier with Mexico.Instead, he envisions ?anywhere from 700 (1,126 km) to 900 miles (1,448 km) of see-through wall?.Trump?s comments on the wall are the most definitive description he has given on what became a primary campaign promise. During the campaign he vowed to oversee construction of a ?big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door? to let approved immigrants come into the United States.But on his way to Paris, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: ?It?s a 2,000-mile border, but you don?t need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don?t really have people crossing.?There are already about 650 miles (1,046 km) of fencing along the border, all of which is see-through.Trump?s remarks were informal and initially not allowed to be reported. The White House later provided a partial transcript of them.The Mexican border in much of Texas is defined by the Rio Grande, though parts of that river are little more than a trickle of water. About 24 miles (38 km) of the border in Arizona is marked by the Colorado river.Trump also said the wall ?needs transparency?.?You have to be able to see through it,? Trump said, adding that border agents need to know what or who is on the other side of the fence to avoid being hit by sacks of drugs and other contraband.?As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don?t see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds (27 kg) of stuff? It?s over,? Trump said.Drug smugglers have tried to fling bundles of drugs over parts of the roughly 650 miles of border that already has fencing or other barriers, using tactics including sling shots and catapults. But it?s unclear if anyone has ever been injured by the flying contraband.This year the government issued two notices for border wall proposals. The first called for a solid structure up to 30 ft (9.14 meters) high that couldn?t be easily breached. The second bid notice called for other types of walls, including something that could be seen through.Homeland security secretary John Kelly has said that border agents need to be able to see what is on the other side of a barrier for security and safety reasons. He has repeatedly said that Trump?s proposed wall would not be ?sea to shining sea?, from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east."
"Posters were put up in Gujarat featuring pictures of 110 senior BJP leaders of the state, with the caption reading, ""Identify the leaders or you will lose your job.""

The caption on it says: ""Identify the leaders or you will lose your job.""This situation arose after action was taken against two employees - a sanitation worker and a security guard - for not recognising the BJP leaders.Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation's standing committee chairperson Manubhai Patel suspended a sanitation worker after the latter allegedly did not recognise him during a surprise visit.In a similar incident a few days ago, a security guard could not recognise Gujarat Assembly Speaker Ramanlal Vora during the latter's visit to Gandhinagar Civil Hospital.While the security guard lost his job, contract of the security agency was reportedly also terminated.Following the two incidents, some unidentified people pasted bills in Gandhinagar. The posters had photographs of 110 leaders, including top politicians and MLAs of the state. The posters had the pictures of Vijay Rupani, Amit Shah and BJP legislators. The photographs of Assembly Speaker Ramanlal Vora and GMC standing committee chairman Manubhai Patel were published prominently.A caption taking a dig at the incident and says on the poster asks the employees to identify the leaders or lose their job. The bills were pasted near the Gujarat Assembly and near Gandhinagar Civil Hospital.However, within a few hours of the posters coming up, some BJP workers reached the place and tore them off.Manubhai Patel blamed Congress for making the incident into a controversy. He alleged that Congress was trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill in view of the forthcoming Assembly elections later this year.On the other hand, the sanitary employee and other staff claimed that Manubhai Patel happened to pass through while they were resting during lunch break. This was the reason that the employee did not recognise him. The employees regretted that one of their colleagues was suspended."
"Authorities in the Central Luzon region of Philippines are reportedly considering issuing Muslim-only IDs to combat terrorism after a city in Mindanao was captured by Islamist militants. The move would allow identification of undesirable individuals and terrorists, officials said. Notably, President Duterte had blamed people of Marawi for sheltering ISIS sympathisers in the besieged city.","Summarise: Police from a region in the majority-Christian Philippines are considering issuing mandatory identification cards to thousands of Muslims living there ? a proposal Human Rights Watch condemned as ?collective punishment?.Authorities in Central Luzon, a region north of the capital, were quoted in local media as saying the policy was a counter-terrorism measure after Islamist militants took over a city hundreds of kilometres to the south on the island of Mindanao.The issue was discussed at a meeting between police, military and political figures and about 200 Muslim religious and community leaders at the provincial capitol building, according to news outlet Rappler.Chief Superintendent Aaron Aquino said the ID cards would allow authorities to identify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists, Rappler reported.He said the system had already been implemented in the town of Paniqui ?and we want this to be replicated in all Muslim communities in the whole region for easy and efficient identification of our Muslim brothers and sisters?.Government forces have been hammering the city of Marawi in the south for nearly two months after local militant factions, who claim allegiance to Isis, rampaged through and took control.President Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across Mindanao and had to apologise after blaming the residents of Marawi by saying they allowed Isis sympathisers to stay.Human Rights Watch said authorities were threatening to ?single out Muslims? with ID cards, violating the rights to equal protection of the law and freedom of movement.?Requiring Muslim-only IDs in response to a perceived failure of Muslims to prevent Islamist fighters from entering Marawi City is a form of collective punishment,? the New York-based advocacy group said in a statement.It added that reports of some Muslim leaders present at the meeting not rejecting outright the compulsory ID cards were ?irrelevant from a rights perspective? for the roughly 26,000 Muslims living in Central Luzon region. ?ID requirements for Muslims should be rejected outright.?"

"A statue of a young girl staring down the bronze Charging Bull came up on Wall Street, New York ahead of International Women's Day on Wednesday. 'The Fearless Girl' statue says, ""Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference."" It was installed by State Street Global Advisors to encourage companies to increase the number of women directors.","Summarise: A new statue of a resolute young girl staring down Wall Street's famous Charging Bull was erected by a major asset managing firm for International Women's Day to make a point: There's a dearth of women on the boards of the largest US corporations.State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, had the statue created to push companies to increase the number of women directors.Artist Kristen Visbal's ""Fearless Girl"" drew crowds Wednesday that initially came to pose for pictures with the bull, but the novelty quickly became a New York hot spot.The girl is sculpted in bronze, her hands firmly planted on her waist, ponytailed head held high.""Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference,"" reads a plaque at her feet.""As a steward of nearly $2.5 trillion of assets, we want to engage with boards and management around issues that we think will drive core results,"" said Lori Heinel, State Street's deputy global chief investment officer. ""And what you find repeatedly is having more diverse boards and more diverse senior management will actually drive better results for companies.""According to ISS Analytics, a business research firm, just 16 per cent of board seats on companies in the Russell 3000 are held by women; the average board of directors has eight men and one woman.""It's going to happen to the end of time unless you change something,"" says Erik Gordon, a lawyer and professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""It's got to not just be the rules. It's got to be the culture.""State Street has three women on an 11-member board.

The city gave its permission for the bull to remain.This week, McCann New York, a top advertising agency, installed the statue of the girl before dawn Tuesday - with a city permit for one week. Negotiations are underway for the piece to remain longer."
Indrani Mukerjea and a few other jail inmates have been accused of using children living with their mothers in Mumbai's Byculla jail as human shields during a recent protest against jail authorities.

The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will reportedly construct two tunnels through Arunachal Pradesh's Sela Pass to cut down the distance to the China border through Tawang by 10 km. The tunnels would reduce travel time by at least an hour and ensure that NH13 and the 171-km stretch between Bomdila and Tawang remain accessible in all weather conditions. ,"Summarise: Itanagar, Jul 24 (PTI) The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will construct two tunnels through 4170-metre-high Sela Pass in Arunachal Pradesh, which would cut down the distance to China border through Tawang by 10 km. ""The tunnels would cut down at least an hour of travel time between the Army?s 4 Corps headquarters at Tezpur and Tawang. Moreover, the tunnels would ensure that NH 13 and especially the 171 km stretch between Bomdila and Tawang, remains accessible in all weather conditions,"" a BRO release said here today. This is in keeping with India?s bid for faster access to the Tibet frontier through the tough terrain of the state in the Eastern Himalayas. RS Rao, the commander of the 42 Border Road Task Force under BRO?s Project Vartak has initiated formal requisition to West Kameng Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sonal Swaroop for acquisition of land for construction of Sela Tunnel, the release said. The project constitutes widening of existing single lane road to NH double lane specifications from Baisaki and then taking off a greenfield alignment of length 12.37 km. It also includes construction of two tunnels of length 475 metres and 1790 meters each through Sela-Chabrela ridge meeting the existing Balipara-Chaudur-Tawang road on Nurarang side, it said. The above alignment has been approved by the Chief Engineer, Project Vartak. There is a shorter but less used road along the Bhutan border via Orang in Assam and Kalaktang in Arunachal Pradesh. ""Due to construction of tunnels across Sela pass the road length reduces by approximately 6.50 km in addition obviates high altitude, steep gradient and hair pin bends on either side of Sela pass which, would bring relief to commuters as lot of hardships have to be faced in winter season due to snowfall at on Sela pass,"" the release said.

"A 3-year-old male leopard was caught outside the forest area near the banks of Yamuna on Saturday, the Delhi Forest Department said. Reportedly, the leopard was first spotted in November and cages were kept outside the forest to trap the animal. According to a wildlife official, the animal is being relocated to Rajaji National Park in Shivalik Ranges near Saharanpur. ","Summarise: After roaming in the wilderness of Capital?s Yamuna Biodiversity Park for over a month?since he was caught on camera for the first time?the three-year-old leopard was caught early Saturday morning.AK Shukla, chief wildlife warden, who has also been entrusted the case of the leopard, told HT that the wild cat was caught outside the forest area near the banks of the Yamuna . ?We did not want to catch the animal till it was in the forest, in his natural ecosystem. The cages were kept outside the forest and the animal was trapped only when it stepped out,? he said.How was the leopard caught?The three-year-old leopard was caught in the cage around 5.30am on Saturday in the phase-I portion of the 457-acre park in North Delhi. When the animal was caught, scientists observed that its belly was flattened as if it had not eaten for a few days.CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), which manages the biodiversity park, said that the animal had wandered into phase-I of the park, which does not have enough prey base.?Phase 2 of the park, where the animal was spotted initially, is an active floodplain where there is ample prey base. In fact when animal was first spotted, its belly was hanging, which shows that it was well-fed. This was also the reason why it probably came out of the biodiversity park, where it was caught,? he said.Shukla concurred with the view. ?We had to move the camera traps and the cage according to the movement of the animal. The cages were set up on the banks of the river where locals have illegally cultivated patches of land,? he confirmed. The leopard under observation at Delhi Zoo in New Delhi on Saturday, after it was caught.What happens to the animal now?Shukla said that the leopard will be taken to the Rajaji National Park in Shivalik Ranges near Saharanpur, to its natural habitat. The animal is likely to be moved on Sunday. The carnivore was taken to the Delhi zoo where its health conditions were tested. Though no external injuries were seen, the animal is still being tested for internal injuries. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of NGO Wildlife SOS, said that their team received a call from the forest department around 9am to help transport the leopard to the zoo. By afternoon around 2pm, the animal was shifted to the zoo, he said.Read: Leopard spotted last month at Yamuna Biodiversity Park, caught?The male leopard was first tranquilised and then transported in an ambulance cum rescue vehicle,? a statement released by the NGO read. Experts not happyWildlife and leopard experts are not happy with this capture and say that this was a ?politically motivated? step.Vidya Athreya, ecologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, said that this move was taken without much thought. ?Capturing the leopard is not a solution. Leopards are known to stay near human habitation. What will you do if more leopards come to the park?? she asked.Athreya said that if the animal is shifted it will increase the chances of it harming humans.?The shock of being trapped confuses the animal and makes it more violent. Leaving it into a new environment will confuse it further and it might harm the humans in the nearby villages. We have seen such instances in Maharashtra in the past,? she said.Studies have shown that leopards have a strong homing tendency that leads them to head back towards the area they were removed from. Guidelines released by the environment ministry in 2011 say, the ?mere sighting of a leopard in the vicinity of human habitations does not necessarily mean that the animal has strayed from a forest and needs to be captured. Arbitrary removal of leopards could lead to increased conflict. The space vacated by a captured animal will soon be occupied by another leopard.?Babu too agreed with Athreya saying that the cycle of a healthy ecosystem will be disturbed by the removal of the animal from here.?With the removal of the top carnivore, the number of herbivores in the ecosystem will multiply. We hope more leopards come into the park and till then we can learn our lessons,? he said. How to avoid conflict?In conflict situations, rather than the management of the animal, it is often a management of people that assumes primacy.Wildlife biologist and expert on leopards, Sanjay Gubbi said that in situations where a leopard becomes visible, people gather and agitate the animal ? rather than letting it leave from the area. ?People living around the area should be educated of how to manage a leopard spotting,? he said."

Akshaye was recently seen as a baddie in Varun Dhawan- John Abraham starrer ""Dishoom"" and is now busy promoting his next film ""Mom"" that features Sridevi in the lead. ""I decided, having taken an off of four years, I wanted to start off with slightly smaller roles to get into that zone. But I was sure I wont do it by compromising on the quality of work. The role could be small, but it should have an impact in the story,"" Akshaye told PTI.

""There was a reason why I took a sabbatical. I had some personal reasons which didnt allow me to work. But there has never been a point in my life where I wanted to take things slow, or I dont want to work. ""Besides work (acting), there is nothing I know or can do.

"The Narendra Modi-led NDA government has repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in its three years in power, compared to 1,301 laws being removed in the 65 years prior to that. The laws include one which states that an inspector in Andhra Pradesh must have well-brushed teeth. Another 200-year-old repealed law allowed the British monarch to review decisions of all Indian courts.","Summarise: Under the Indian Motor Vehicles Act 1914, an inspector in Andhra Pradesh must have well-brushed teeth, and will be disqualified if he has a pigeon chest, knock knees, flatfeet and hammer toes.This is one among a tangle of bizarre, archaic laws, which survived for years like a relic in a museum but with no relevance in modern India.Many of these rules put up obstacles to running smooth administration and ease to do business. The Narendra Modi government had made it clear at its inception that it was time for these dinosaurs to go extinct.Among the myriad laws in India, there are those that made strange demands. A century-old one said the toll tax for boats ferrying passengers across the river Ganga cannot be more than two annas - a denomination not in use any more.According to another one, policemen in some states have to ensure that air-dropped pamphlets do not fall in their areas. This was aimed to foil the propaganda campaign during World War II.A 200-year-old law allowed the British monarch to review decisions of all Indian courts. But these Acts are now history.OLD LAWS SWIFTLY SCRAPPED The Modi government is creating a record of sorts in scrapping these old, redundant and archaic laws from statute books.While successive governments could remove just 1,301 obsolete laws which came in the way of smooth administration and economic growth in 65 years, the present central government has managed to weed out as many as 1,200 Acts in just three years. As many as 1,824 more obsolete central Acts have been identified for repeal.The Opposition-dominated Upper House too played its part when it passed the bills concerning repeal of 1,159 central laws. The Rajya Sabha passed four such bills.""The Modi government is determined to relegate several archaic Acts to history. Laws need to be consonant with the times. 1,200 redundant Acts have been scrapped. 1,824 more have been identified for repeal,"" said law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.Before this, under the Indian Aircraft Act, 1934, kites were also aircraft and you needed to obtain a permit as required for an aeroplane.Under the Indian Treasure Trove Act, 1878 you could have been jailed if you found anything worth more than Rs 10 and did not report it to a revenue officer. POLL PROMISEDuring the 2014 election campaign, Modi promised that if the BJP came to power, for every law passed, his government would repeal 10 obsolete ones.Laws on licence to kill and capture of wild elephants in certain circumstances, segregation and medical treatment of lepers, regulating the grant of titles to qualified persons in western medical science and prohibition of pledging of labour of children (child slavery) are among those abolished.Also have been dumped some archaic rules regulating recruitment of foreigners during pre-Independence period, agreement with Pakistan on exchange of prisoners, continuation of use of courts in Bengal, Assam and Punjab for those who migrated to Pakistan and power to regulate prices of newspapers. There were many more laws in the statute books which had been of no use as provisions of most of the old Acts had already been incorporated in new legislation.But time is running out for such laws. The government had formed a committee headed by R Ramanujam, secretary to the prime minister's office, to re-examine all Acts recommended to be repealed by the earlier committee on Review of Administrative Laws set up by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1998.After taking the help of the Law Commission, the panel is submitting periodic reports.

"Following the successful staging of the Pakistan Super League final, the International Cricket Council will be sending a World XI team to Lahore in September for a four-match T20 series against Pakistan. The tournament, called 'The Independence Cup', will be held to make efforts for the re-introduction of top-level cricket to Pakistan after an eight-year hiatus. ","Summarise: The International Cricket Council is planning to send a World XI to Pakistan in late September for a four-match Twenty20 series in Lahore that will look to build on the successful staging of the Pakistan Super League final in the city on Sunday.The four-match series at the Gaddafi Stadium ? to be called The Independence Cup to mark the 70th anniversary of partition ? is intended to continue the reintroduction of top-level cricket to the country after a near eight-year hiatus. The break resulted from the attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in 2009 and has meant Pakistan, bar one series against Zimbabwe two years ago, have played home internationals at neutral venues.Details of which players will feature in the World XI are yet to be established. Six overseas cricketers ? including Kevin Pietersen, Luke Wright and Tymal Mills ? withdrew from Sunday?s PSL final following the tournament?s switch from the United Arab Emirates and in light of two bomb blasts in the preceding weeks.England?s Chris Jordan and the Middlesex batsman Dawid Malan, along with the former West Indies captain Darren Sammy, were among the eight who travelled as, amid a military-style security operation that saw the city in lockdown and bulletproof team buses escorted by elite troops, the match passed without incident.

Clarke said. ?The world of cricket needs to help Pakistan, who cannot continue to play their home fixtures overseas. The youth need inspiring, and the national teams need far more cricket played in familiar terrain.

"Defence Minister Arun Jaitley has said that China is trying to enter India's territory and added that India is not entering into any country's land. Further reacting to China asking India to withdraw troops from Bhutan border areas and recall the 1962 war, Jaitley said, ""India of 2017 is different from India of 1962. Those were different situations.""","Summarise: Defence Minister Arun Jaitley today brushed aside China's warning about the ongoing face-off along Bhutan border.Asking India to withdraw troops from Bhutan border areas, China said that India should recall the 1962 war and learn a lesson.Responding to the remarks made by the Chinese foreign ministry, Arun Jaitley said, ""India of 2017 is different from India of 1962. Those were different situations.""Jaitley said China is trying to encroach on Bhutan's land. He said, ""Statements issued by Bhutan make it clear that this is the land of Bhutan. It is located near India's land. There is an arrangement between India and Bhutan for giving protection in the border region.""Jaitley further said that Bhutan has appropriately pointed out that China was trying to usurp its land. India is not entering into any other country's land what China is doing, Jaitley said.Earlier, Bhutan issued a demarche to China yesterday over the construction of a road towards its Army camp in Zomplri area of Doklam and asked Beijing to restore status quo by stopping the work immediately.The demarche by Bhutan comes at a time when there is an ongoing face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in the Doklam (also known as Donglang) area of the Sikkim sector.Doklam is a disputed territory and Bhutan has a written agreement with China that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, peace and tranquillity should be maintained in the area. This came after China accused India of having a ""hidden agenda"" in the current military stand-off with it in the Sikkim sector where Beijing has a territorial dispute with Bhutan.MEA'S REBUTTALThe Ministry of External Affairs has issued a point-by-point rebuttal. Here's the full text.""The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on 26 June 2017 alleging that Indian border troops crossed the boundary line in the Sikkim sector of the China-India boundary and entered Chinese territory. This has been reiterated since then in other Chinese official briefings. 2.The facts of the matter are as follows:i. On 16 June, a PLA construction party entered the Doklam area and attempted to construct a road. It is our understanding that a Royal Bhutan Army patrol attempted to dissuade them from this unilateral activity.Â  The Ambassador of the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) has publicly stated that it lodged a protest with the Chinese Government through their Embassy in New Delhi on 20 June.ii. Yesterday, the Foreign Ministry of Bhutan has also issued a statement underlining that the construction of the road inside Bhutanese territory is a direct violation of the 1988 and 1998 agreements between Bhutan and China and affects the process of demarcating the boundary between these two countries. They have urged a return to the status quo as before 16 June 2017.iii. In keeping with their tradition of maintaining close consultation on matters of mutual interest, RGOB and the Government of India have been in continuous contact through the unfolding of these developments. iv. In coordination with the RGOB, Indian personnel, who were present at general area Doka La, approached the Chinese construction party and urged them to desist from changing the status quo. These efforts continue.v. The matter has been under discussion between India and China at the diplomatic level in the Foreign Ministries since then, both in New Delhi and Beijing.Â  It was also the subject of a Border Personnel Meeting at Nathu La on 20 June. 3. India is deeply concerned at the recent Chinese actions and has conveyed to the Chinese Government that such construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India. 4. In this context, the Indian side has underlined that the two Governments had in 2012 reached agreement that the tri-junction boundary points between India, China and third countries will be finalized in consultation with the concerned countries.Â  Any attempt, therefore, to unilaterally determine tri-junction points is in violation of this understanding. 5. Where the boundary in the Sikkim sector is concerned, India and China had reached an understanding also in 2012 reconfirming their mutual agreement on the ""basis of the alignment"". Further discussions regarding finalization of the boundary have been taking place under the Special Representatives framework.6. It is essential that all parties concerned display utmost restraint and abide by their respective bilateral understandings not to change the status quo unilaterally. It is also important that the consensus reached between India and China through the Special Representatives process is scrupulously respected by both sides. 7. India has consistently taken a positive approach to the settlement of its own boundary with China, along with the associated issue of the tri-junctions. 8. India cherishes peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas. It has not come easily. Both sides have worked hard to establish institutional framework to discuss all issues to ensure peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.

"Actor Prateik Babbar, while speaking about dealing with drug addiction, said substance abuse is like a bad marriage.

Prateik further said, ""Addiction is not a moral failing, it doesn't make you a bad person even if you have made a poor choice"".","Summarise: It took him five years and lot of courage to openly speak about his battle with drug addiction. After making a promising start in Bollywood, Prateik Babbar vanished from the limelight for a good five years. His absence might not have caught anybody's attention, but his return has grabbed many eyeballs. And why not?

It was last year when he first talked about his drug addiction, and in the last one year, he has been a ""work in progress"". ""Addiction is not a moral failing, it does not make you a bad person even if you have made a poor choice. People still think I got hooked because it was 'cool' for a celebrity to indulge in recreational drugs. But for me, it was more of an escape from reality. My childhood was complicated and there were a lot of questions I didn't have answers to so I looked elsewhere for solace,"" said Prateik. Â On acceptanceIt took him a while to understand that he was an addict, and he needed to get out of it as soon as possible. ""Acceptance and speaking up can help change the face of addiction.

Substance abuse is like a bad marriage, even after you quit, it haunts you for a while till people start noticing the turnaround. I'm answerable to only my conscience. And yes, people take me more seriously now that I'm no longer the hippie rave but someone committed to fitness, auditions and family.""On his careerHe began his career with the 2008 film Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, and went onto bag a few promising roles in the subsequent years. However, it's been almost five years since Prateik has been seen on the big screen.

"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath rejected 85-year-old 'Metro Man' E Sreedharan's resignation as the state's metro advisor, and handed him three more projects. The first phase of the Lucknow metro is ready, while plans for Varanasi have been made. ""The UP CM now wants metros in Agra and Meerut too, along with Kanpur,"" Sreedharan said.","Summarise: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has put Metro Man E Sreedharan back on track. The priest-turned-politician's pro-development push is set to see the train system chug into six cities of the state even before their population eligibility make the cut. Sreedharan delivered his home project, Kochi Metro, last month. On turning 85, he planned to ""hang his boots"", and met the UP CM to convey his decision of retiring from his advisory role to the state government. ""The UP CM not only did not allow me to tender my resignation but added the responsibility of planning metros for three more cities. He is very keen on getting the metro to his own constituency, Gorakhpur,"" Sreedharan said in Kochi on Thursday.While the first phase of metro will be commissioned for commercial operations in state capital Lucknow any time now, the home turfs of Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be gifted a metro rail much before they make it to the merit list. ""While the phase I project, a 10.5-km line for Lucknow is ready for inspection by the Commissioner for Metro Rail Safety and will be thrown open to the public once it gets a nod, detailed project reports for Varanasi have already been made,"" said Sreedharan. ""The UP CM now wants metros in Agra and Meerut too, along with Kanpur. For Meerut, there are already plans of linking it with the Rapid Rail.""MORE BUSINESSA boom in the development of mass transit metro projects in India is not only helping free up choked roads, but is also generating business opportunities as the country ploughs funds into updating its creaky public transport system. Adityanath's metro push, however, has to circumvent a wall of heritage structures in UP's temple towns. The plan for Varanasi proposed by Sreedharan met with the CM's disapproval as it went precariously close to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.""We are now going to redesign the plan and are working on a light metro project for the city that will cost less, reduce noise and vibrations,"" Sreedharan added.Metro projects are usually commissioned for cities with a population of over two million (20 lakh) residents whereas light metro, which is yet to be implemented in any Indian city so far, is proposed for those with population between one and two million. State governments, however, can plan or propose a metro system in advance, looking at a city's long-term transportation requirements, tourism indices and a comprehensive mobility plan is drafted to study the feasibility of the project.Comparing the construction of metro rail with China, Sreedharan pointed out, ""While China builds 300 km of metro rail per year, India lags far behind with only 22 km a year.""As the dust settles following rumours of his running for the post of President, Sreedharan insists he was never spoken to about a possible nomination. ""It was entirely kite-flying by the media. No one from the government spoke to me about it. In fact even if someone did, I would have turned it down. I am 85. Do you think I will survive another five years?"" he laughed.As the Delhi Metro grapples with unprecedented delays in line openings and commuter rush, Sreedharan, who introduced the transport system to the city, said, ""Ever since I retired from Delhi Metro, I ensured that even my shadow does not hover around the place. The new MD and team are very competent. The challenges today are very different but they have worked very well.""Also WATCH:"

Thupten Rinpoche was in tears as he read out the welcome speech for Dalai Lama. In a moment, his throat choked and he stopped reading, and started crying inconsolably. Within minutes, half of the gathering was in tears as they saw Dalai Lama in the prayer hall. TEACHINGS OF RAMA AND BUDDHA Thupten said, ""Bodh Gaya teachings and message are being spread across the world by Dalai Lama. We are lucky to have you here. Thanks for coming.""""We welcome you with a heavy yet happy heart. You are (our) guru... We are blessed to listen to you. The temple and the monastery have been built only because of your blessings,"" Thupten said, who is the in-charge of the monastery. At the monastery, teachings of Lord Rama and Buddha are taught as is the Gita. These teachings--monastery has teachers from South India too--are delivered thrice a week and anyone can attend the sessions.INDIA LOSING ITS SPIRITUALITYPhurpa Tsering, MLA Dirang and parliamentary secretary for health in Chief Minister Pema Khandu's cabinet, also gave an emotional welcome to Dalai Lama.""We are blessed to learn words of wisdom from His Holiness. It was the sudden change of programme to travel by road instead of air that has given an opportunity to everyone to get your blessings,"" Phurpa Tsering said. Governor of Arunachal Pradesh P B Acharya harped on the need for spirituality and spiritual leaders.""We are a secular country but we are losing our spirituality. Without spirituality, we will become demons. There are 500 universities which provide knowledge but don't produce human beings who can share,"" the Governor said. ""You are an 82-year-old young man who travels extensively. Please give us your time; you are a living god and saint. India will lead with you,"" P B Acharya said. ""Modi is a great man and India has the potential to become a world leader. We share borders with countries like China and Myanmar. We need you in the Northeast. We want peace and you can guide us,"" Acharya said.INDIA-TIBET RELATION IS SPECIALDalai Lama talked abut the guru-chela relationship between India and Tibet. ""India is historically our guru and we Tibetans are the chela,"" he said. ""India is the land of Buddha... India and Tibet relationship is very special,"" Dalai Lama said.ALSO READ:"
An art exhibition named 'Cadmium Skies' in Delhi will showcase the works of 26 children that have been inspired by painter Vincent Van Gogh. Recreations of Van Gogh's famous works such as 'Starry Night' and 'Sunflowers' will be on display. Original creations where the participants have employed Van Gogh's techniques and not recreated his work will also be displayed.,"Summarise: Art is not restricted to age and will never be. Cadmium Skies, an exhibition in the Capital showcasing the artworks of 26 children, is a testimony to this fact. The artworks on display are inspired by Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent Van Gogh?s works. Right from a six-year-old to a 16-year-old, all students have dedicated their artworks to him. But before these young artists embarked on their pursuits, they not only studied Van Gogh?s artworks and techniques in detail but also read up on his life and struggle, which in itself is an inspiration for any budding artist.Jehaan Mehta?s artwork on display at the exhibition.The exhibition is a visual treat. On display are recreations of Van Gogh?s famous works such as Starry Night, Sunflowers and others. And then there are original creations, where the participants have only employed Van Gogh?s techniques rather than imitating his artworks.Among the group of 26 children is 15-year-old Ishaana Soni, who has been learning art for the past twelve years. Her mother Silvia Soni says, ?Their teacher, Gagan aunty, explained to the kids the importance of studying the artist and the technique. What started as a hobby class quickly turned into passion for art for Ishaana.? Lavanya Kandhari?s  artwork inspired by Gogh?s The Starry Night.Proceeds from the sale of artworks will be donated to an animal sanctuary, to reflect the love these kids have for animals. ?One of the parents has even put together a beautiful catalogue of the children?s works for us to keep as a memento,? adds Silvia.CATCH IT LIVEWHAT: Cadmium Skies WHERE: Wonderwall Gallery, Lado SaraiWHEN: April 8TIMINGS: 5.30- 7.00 pm NEAREST METRO STATION: Saket on the Yellow Line "
"Responding to Saif Ali Khan's letter wherein he discussed nepotism and genetics, Kangana Ranaut wrote in her letter that she'd be a farmer if Saif's point on genetics was true. She added, ""Are you implying that artistic skills, hard-work...can be inherited through genes?"" Saif had written about people being interested in star kids and if they'll have their parents' genes.","Summarise: All hell broke loose when Karan Johar, Saif Ali Khan and Varun Dhawan took a dig at Kangana Ranaut at the recently held IIFA Awards. Unless you have been living under a rock, you know that Kangana had called Karan the ""flag-bearer of nepotism"" on his show. The comment snowballed into a huge debate, with fans supporting Kangana for bravely taking on Bollywood's big daddies.The debate was reignited at the IIFA Awards this year, when Varun came on stage to receive an award. Saif joked, ""You are here because of your papa (director David Dhawan)."" Varun responded, ""And you're here because of your mummy (veteran actress Sharmila Tagore)."" Karan joined in and said, ""I am here because of my papa (late filmmaker Yash Johar).""The trio then chanted in unison, ""Nepotism rocks"". They then broke into the song Bole Chudiye Bole Kangana, at which point Karan interjected, ""Kangana nahi bole toh achcha hai, bahut bolti hai.""The act caused outrage on social media and Karan, Saif and Varun were forced to apologise. Saif went a step further and wrote an open letter (first published in DNA), prompting Kangana to finally break her silence and pen her own open letter in Mid-Day.She said that the last time she was ""deeply pained and upset"" about the subject was when Karan dismissed talent as one of the main criteria for making it big in Bollywood. Citing the examples of legends like Dilip Kumar, Satyajit Ray and Guru Dutt, Kangana said that discrediting talent was ""absolutely bizarre."" The actor added that there are plenty of instances to prove that ""genuine hard work"" exists, ""beyond the superficiality of branded clothes and polished accents.""Talking about Saif's letter, she dismissed his statement that people need to ""take a chill pill and back off"" because he has already apologised to her. ""This is not my issue alone,"" Kangana wrote, adding that nepotism ""fails the test of objectivity and rationale."" She added that Swami Vivekananda, Albert Einstein and William Shakespeare ""didn't belong to a select few, they belonged to collective humanity.""She also addressed his remark that it was easy to confuse nepotism with genetics. Saif had written, ""People are interested in what their (superstars') children will be like and whether they will have the genes of their parents, in terms of their talent. If you need another example, then take race horses. We take a derby winner, mate him with the right mate and see if we can create another grand national winner. So, in that sense, this is the relationship between genetics and star kids.""""I fail to understand how you can compare genetically hybrid racehorses to artistes,"" Kangana wrote, asking if Saif believed that talent and dedication was only hereditary. ""If your point was true, I would be a farmer back home,"" she said.The Queen actor added, ""You also spoke of eugenics - which means controlled breeding of the human race. So far, I believe that the human race hasn't found the DNA that can pass on greatness and excellence. If it had, we would've loved to repeat the greatness of Einstein, Da Vinci, Shakespeare, Vivekananda, Stephen Hawking, Terence Tao, Daniel Day-Lewis, or Gerhard Richter.""Saif had blamed the media for perpetrating nepotism. He had said that his son, Taimur, was a paparazzi favourite before he turned a year old and is already hyped to be the ""next big thing."" It is only a matter of time before a producer cashes in on all that hype. Kangana rebutted with, ""No one is putting a gun to anyone's head to hire talent they don't believe in. So, there is no need to get defensive about one's choices.""Is there going to be a round two of debate? Let's wait and watch."
"Ethnic-wear brand Fabindia has started removing brand name 'Khadi' from its products after a legal notice by Khadi India alleged that the use of the word amounted to ""unfair trade practice"". Fabindia stated it has complied with the directions issued, reports said. Notably, Fabindia was asked to immediately stop using 'Khadi' from its products and remove display banners from showrooms.","Summarise: Fabindia has started removing the brand name Khadi it uses to promote its cotton products after a legal notice by Khadi India that the use of the word amounted to ""unfair trade practice"" and misusing its trade name. Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC) had sent a legal notice to Fabindia Overseas Pvt Ltd, a chain of ethnic wear retail outlet, asking it to immediately stop using the word Khadi from all its cotton products and remove display banners from its showrooms. Sources said Fabindia CEO Viney Singh has responded to KVICs notice, saying it was complying with all the directions of the KVIC. Fabindia has stated that ""as per the direction issued"" by KVIC, it has complied with them, they said. Fabindia, in its reply, has also sought a meeting with KVIC officials to explain its position in order to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of Khadi India. KVIC Chairman V K Saxena, who justified serving the legal notice, referred to the earlier communications with Fabindia by which the private firms application for Khadi mark was treated as closed. He cited a September 29, 2016 letter which stated that ""upon the request of Fabindia, several meetings were held with KVIC and the last meeting was held on August 2, 2016, with Chairman of KVIC at New Delhi. During the meeting, it was assured that Fabindia will communicate their consent shortly.

Henceforth, no correspondence on this subject will be entertained,"" the communication said. KHADI MARK Saxena also drew attention to a February 16 letter of KVIC in which it was decided to issue Khadi mark certificate in favour of Fabindia to carry out trading/selling of genuine Khadi and Khadi products attaching Khadi mark tags/labels, subject to several conditions which were also mentioned. KVIC, which is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, had accused Fabindia of misleading and confusing the consumers by promoting its goods under its registered trade mark Khadi.In the February 8 legal notice addressed to Fabindia's New Delhi-based CEO, KVIC had said, ""You are called upon to explain your position in the above matter within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice, failing which the KVIC will be constrained to proceed against your company as per law for the violation of Khadi Mark Regulation and payment or incidental damages for the losses caused to KVIC by Fabindia.""It also said Fabindia was denied the certificate to use the brand name as it did not adhere to the procedural formalities for Khadi mark certification which was discussed with its representatives."

"An engineer working for an electricity distribution company died in Delhi's Jaffarpur Kalan on Monday, after his car hit a tree while he was allegedly being chased by a mob during an anti-power theft raid. The company said its teams were chased by bike-borne goons and added that they had received a tip about large-scale power theft in the area.","Summarise: A BSES engineer died and four persons were injured today as their car rammed a tree while allegedly being chased by a mob during an anti-power theft drive in south west Delhi's Jaffarpur Kalan area, a BSES spokesperson said. The police, however, refuted the claim and said the engineer died in a suspected case of rash driving. According to the BSES spokesperson, three discom teams raided Jhul Jhuli village in Jaffarpur Kalan this afternoon following a tip-off about large-scale power theft in the area. The teams, accompanied by Delhi Police, came under attack and had to retreat, he said. ""The teams were chased by bike-borne goons. In the ensuing melee, one of the cars rammed a tree. Assistant engineer Abhimanyu Singh (32) was grievously injured. He later died,"" he said. A senior police officer said the BSES teams were provided adequate police force for the raid which went ""successfully"". ""Twenty six police personnel were accompanying the BSES teams. The anti power theft drive was successful. ""One of the cars met with an accident. No one was being chased as per initial reports,"" said the officer. A case has been registered in the matter, he said, adding the four injured BSES team members have been admitted to a hospital. In June this year, a Delhi Police sub-inspector and three BSES employees were injured in stone-pelting by locals during an anti-power theft drive in outer Delhi's Ranhola area. ISOLATED INCIDENTS ""These are not isolated incidents. Efforts of discom teams to check irregularities are often thwarted by law- defying people who function like organised gangs. Power theft has taken shape of an organised crime and active police support is needed to curb this menace,"" said the BSES spokesperson. Despite intensive efforts to reduce power theft, Jaffarpur continues to incur 60 per cent losses, he said. In the last five years, around 14,000 cases of power theft, having a connected load of around 33,000 KW, have been unearthed in the area, the spokesman added. Also Read:"
"Telecom giant BT has been fined $53 million (?345 crore) for a ""serious breach"" of rules, making it the largest fine imposed on a telco. BT will also have to pay $376 million (?2,440 crore) in compensation to rivals. BT allegedly misused its contracts to cut compensation payments for delays in connecting high-speed business lines to other telcos including Vodafone.","Summarise: BT has been fined Â£42m, the largest penalty imposed by regulator Ofcom, and will have to pay an estimated Â£300m in compensation to rival telecoms companies over delays installing high-speed internet connections.Ofcom found that BT broke rules put in place to stop Openreach, its subsidiary that controls the UK broadband infrastructure network, abusing its ?significant market power? by cutting compensation payments to rivals, blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case.BT said it expected to pay out Â£300m in compensation to rivals including Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk for the ?serious breach? of Ofcom?s rules.?The size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses,? said Gaucho Rasmussen, investigations director at Ofcom. ?Our message is clear ? we will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. Millions of people rely on BT?s network for the phone and broadband services they use every day.?Compensation must be paid to affected providers within 12 months, Ofcom said.The record Â£42m penalty, which was reduced from Â£60m after BT admitted full liability and agreed to pay back rivals, is more than 11 times greater than the previous largest fine levied on a telecoms operator by Ofcom. Last year, Vodafone was fined Â£3.7m for taking pay-as-you-go customers? money without providing a service. BT?s fine is more than seven times that of the second largest penalty handed down, the Â£5.7m ITV had to pay in 2008 over the ?abuse? of premium-rate phone lines in a number of hit shows.Ofcom?s investigation into BT focused on the installation of high-speed business lines, known as ethernet services, which provide connections for big businesses as well as organisations including schools, hospitals and libraries, between January 2013 and December 2014. It was instigated after a complaint from Vodafone, which relies on BT ethernet services to transmit data between its mobile masts. Vodafone accused Openreach of failing to meet its 30-day installation guarantee but then reclassifying the delay as having been agreed by rivals which allowed it to avoid paying compensation.?These high-speed lines are a vital part of this country?s digital backbone,? said Rasmussen. ?We found BT broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time.?BT was also fined Â£300,000 for ?failing to provide information to Ofcom?.?We apologise wholeheartedly for the mistakes Openreach made in the past when processing orders for a number of high-speed business connections,? said Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach. ?This shouldn?t have happened and we fully accept Ofcom?s findings.? A spokesman for Vodafone said: ?We hope this ruling will encourage BT Openreach to finally drop the unacceptable practices it has used to avoid paying compensation for late delivery of fixed fibre lines, which have impacted businesses across the country as well as our own 4G roll-out.?Less than half (48.8%) of high speed ethernet installations were completed within 30 days, according to Openreach?s own statistics for the final quarter of last year.However, Openreach said that almost 87% of installations are completed by the original agreed date, and that the number of outstanding orders is at a 34-month low.Rivals have repeatedly called for Openreach, responsible for building and maintaining the tens of millions of copper and fibre lines that run from telephone exchanges to homes and businesses across the UK, to be split from BT.They argue that BT has dragged its heels in opening the network to their engineers, which has hampered their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access.This month BT finally agreed a halfway house deal to legally separate Openreach, after two years of wrangling with Ofcom, which wants to strengthen the independence of the broadband network operator to promote competition and boost superfast services.The Â£42m penalty follows a bad week for BT after Ofcom fined subsidiary Plusnet Â£880,000 for continuing to charge more than 1,000 customers more than Â£500,000 after they had cancelled their accounts.The fine is the latest headache for Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT, who has endured a torrid year that included an accounting scandal at its Italian operation that wiped Â£8bn off its shares.?The investigation ? revealed we fell short of the high standards we expect in serving our communications provider customers,? Patterson said. ?We take this issue very seriously and we have put in place measures, controls and people to prevent it happening again. My management team and I are determined that BT applies the highest standards when serving our customers.?This month BT, which is to introduce inflation-busting price rises for its customers, denied it was forcing them to foot the bill to pay for its new Â£1.2bn Champions League football rights deal."

"A 27-year-old Bangladeshi named Abul Bajandar, dubbed the ""tree man"" for the bark-like lesions over his body, regained use of his hands after undergoing at least 16 surgeries for the treatment of one of the rarest diseases. Around five kilograms of growths were removed from his body, who is one of only four people to be diagnosed with epidermodysplasia verruciformis.","Summarise: A Bangladeshi father dubbed the ?tree man? because of the bark-like warts that once covered his body will soon be able to leave hospital after groundbreaking treatment for one of the world?s rarest diseases.Abul Bajandar has undergone at least 16 operations to remove 5kg (11 pounds) of growths from his hands and feet since his condition came to doctors? attention a year ago. The 27-year-old former rickshaw driver is one of only four people in the world to be diagnosed with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an extremely rare genetic condition dubbed ?tree-man disease? that left him unable to hold his three-year-old daughter. ?Bajandar?s cure was a remarkable milestone in the history of medical science,? said Samanta Lal Sen, plastic surgery coordinator at Dhaka Medical College hospital. ?We operated on him at least 16 times to remove the warts. The hands and feet are now almost fine. He will be discharged within the next 30 days after a couple of minor surgeries to perfect the shape of his hands,? Sen said. Sen believes Bajandar could become the first person to be cured of the disease, provided the warts do not grow back. Last year an Indonesian man died of the rare genetic condition. Speaking from his bed at the hospital, which has been treating him free of charge, Bajandar said the pain of his condition had been unbearable. ?I never thought I would ever be able to hold my kid with my hands,? he said, showing a bandaged hand. ?Now I feel so much better. I can hold my daughter in my lap and play with her. I can?t wait to go back home.?The plight of Bajandar, who comes from a village in the southern coastal district of Khulna, was brought to wider attention after his condition was widely covered in local and international media. He met his wife, Halima Khatun, before he contracted the disease, but it had taken hold by the time they married ? the union took place against her parents? wishes. All three have lived in the hospital since he was admitted for the first surgery nearly a year ago. ?He is probably the most loved and longest-staying patient in this hospital,? said duty doctor Nurun Nahar. Bajandar initially thought the warts were harmless, but they eventually covered his hands and feet, forcing him to stop working. Now he plans to set up a small business using donations received from well-wishers across the world. ?I was so worried about raising my daughter,? he said. ?I hope the curse won?t return again.? "

In a press statement today, the EC called the allegations of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress as ""baseless"" and clarified that VVPAT machines are not required by the law to be retained in strong room for the purpose of election petition and are available for use in any other election.However, in the ongoing by-elections only VVPAT machines, which were kept in reserve and not used during the actual poll, have been redeployed.WHAT THE EC STATEMENT SAIDThe EC statement said, ""Certain baseless observations and allegations have been made by a leader of a political party today in a press conference regarding the use of EVMs. It has been alleged that EVMs as per law cannot be taken out for 45 days from the date of declaration of results but still EVMs for the by-polls in the Madhya Pradesh were taken out and shifted from Uttar Pradesh where the results have been declared on March 11, 2017 and hence the 45 days period is still not over.""Clarifying the legal position, EC said the EVMs comprising the Control Unit (CU) and Ballot Unit (BU) used in any election are kept in a strong room after declaration of results and are not accessed by anyone till the period of filing of election petition is over. The election petition has to be filed within 45 days.However, in case of VVPAT machines, the printed paper slips have to be retrieved at the time of counting and sealed in a paper envelope and only these sealed paper slips have to be kept inside the strong room along with the EVMs.It further said, ""The VVPAT machines are not required by the law to be retained in strong room for the purpose of election petition and are available for use in any other election. However, in the on-going bye-polls only VVPAT machines which were kept in reserve and not used during the actual poll, have been redeployed.""""Aspersions have also been cast on EC that EVMs from Uttar Pradesh were moved to Bhind, Madhya Pradesh. The Commission would like to point out that these allegations are completely baseless and made without verifying the facts. No EVMs have been moved from Uttar Pradesh for the purpose of bye-polls in Madhya Pradesh,"" it said.The statement claimed that required number of VVPAT machines was moved from different states for use in bye-polls as per the existing policy of EC. ""This is because 53,500 VVPAT machines, available with the Commission, were deployed during the recently concluded polls in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur.""The Commission would like to clarify that in any election a certain percentage of EVMs and VVPAT machines are kept in reserve so that EVMs and VVPAT machines deployed on the poll day can be replaced, if required. The EVMs and VVPATs kept in reserve also go through the stringent protocol of first level checking, randomisation and loading of symbols during the candidates setting in the presence of representatives of candidates and political parties. Hence, the VVPATs that were sent to Bhind had the previous symbols loaded from Uttar Pradesh,"" it said.EC said, ""This is a standard protocol and there was nothing amiss in this. According to standard protocol, the old symbols are erased only during first level checking before the next poll. However, it was not done when the demonstration was made on March 31, 2017 at Bhind. As per the Commission's instructions, any training or demonstration is commenced only after completing the first level checking which was missed out at Bhind for which Commission has replaced the District Election Officer,"" and added that the report of special officer deputed to inquire into allegations of multiple printing of paper slips of a particular political party at Ater (Bhind) is awaited and would be made public.Also Read:EVM software is bugged, dare Election Commission to reveal its name to us: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal"
"According to IMF's Asia and Pacific Department's Assistant Director Paul Cashin, one way to characterise India's demonetisation is as a ""vacuum cleaner"". ""It's sucking in cash, withdrawing it from the economy, and then the vacuum cleaner is going in reverse, slowly replacing cash,"" he stated. It has led to a lot of cash shortages that adversely affected consumption, he added.","Summarise: From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 24 (PTI) Indias demonetisation led to huge cash shortages that have ""adversely affected"" consumption and like a ""vacuum cleaner"" it sucked in cash and then was slowly replacing the currency, a senior IMF official has said. ""Youve heard about so-called helicopter drops of money with unconventional monetary policies, so one way to characterise this demonetisation initiative is as a vacuum cleaner,"" Paul A Cashin, Assistant Director in the IMFs Asia and Pacific Department, and mission chief of India, told PTI. ""Its sucking in cash, withdrawing it from the economy, and then the vacuum cleaner is going in reverse, slowly replacing cash but as I said, at a fairly modest pace. Thats led to a lot of cash shortages that have adversely affected consumption,"" Cashin said in response to a question as the IMF released its annual country-report on India. Given the shortage of cash in the market, IMF in its report urged the Indian Government to continue to enhance the supply of new banknotes, and if needed consider extending or expanding targeted temporary exemptions, including on use of old banknotes, particularly for rural and remote areas. ""While the financial system is expected to weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth slowdown, the authorities should remain vigilant given the potential further build-up of NPAs and elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities, and ensure prudent support to the economic sectors affected by the currency exchange initiative,"" the IMF said. IMF said the repercussions from Indias currency exchange initiative will likely persist through the first quarter of 2017. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 6.6 per cent in FY2016/17 and then rebound to 7.2 per cent in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions (primarily to private consumption) caused by cash shortages accompanying the currency exchange initiative.

When the woman expressed her inability in providing him with the money, the 'predator' cop asked her to 'compromise' if she wanted her man to be free.Charan told the woman that he will come at her house in night to 'enjoy' and spend some time with her. Stunned by what she heard, the woman immediately approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). After verifying the facts, ACB sleuths laid a trap to nab Kamaldan Charan red handed. HOW THE PERVERT COP WAS ARRESTEDCharan told the woman he would visit her on Tuesday night when is out on patrolling duty. The ACB was informed about this. He reached the woman's house on time and bolted the doors from inside. Before he could proceed according to his plan, the door bell rang. Charan's game was over. The ACB arrested him red handed with the Rs 1 lakh cheque that the woman had given him. ALSO READ:Bhopal: Cops beat 80-year-old woman with sticks, break her bones for 'ordering ruckus'"

"Boxer Floyd Mayweather called Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor a ""fa***t"" and accused him of racism on the last leg of their three-country tour in London on Friday. ""He totally disrespected black women. He called black people monkeys. Then he spoke disrespectfully to my mother and my daughter. There are certain levels you don't stoop to,"" said Mayweather.","Summarise: Floyd Mayweather attacked Conor McGregor with a homophobic slur and accused the UFC fighter of racism in the final leg of a promotional tour that has descended into an ugly war of words. The UFC lightweight champion was again forced to defend himself against allegations of racism as Mayweather rounded on him at a heated press call in front of 10,000 fans at Wembley Arena.?Racism still exists. It?s all about treating people like you want to be treated. To get respect you must give respect,? said Mayweather, who then called McGregor a ?faggot? on stage.?He totally disrespected black women. He called black people monkeys. Then he spoke disrespectfully to my mother and my daughter. There are certain levels you don?t stoop to and certain levels you just don?t go to. I love everybody from all walks of life.?Claims of racism against McGregor were first levelled during the opening two legs of the four-date journey through North America and Europe to generate publicity for their August 26 clash. McGregor told Mayweather ?dance for me, boy? ? a phrase with racial overtones. In New York, the UFC lightweight champion had only inflamed the issue, saying he was ?half-black from the belly button down? before appearing to refer to black people as ?dancing monkeys? when discussing the film Rocky III on a chat show.Irishman McGregor, who has predicted he will win inside four rounds despite never having previously boxed as a professional, vehemently denied being a racist.?You can be fooled by [Mayweather] if you want to be fooled by him. You know the man?s character and his history. He?s trying to sway people in his favour and it?s a cheap move,? McGregor said. ?I was trying to address something in my own little way but whatever, if he feels it?s disrespectful then he?s an idiot and fuck him as well. It?s a dirty play. I think [the accusation] is ridiculous. I don?t understand it. I know who I am as a person and I think that most realistic people will look at me and know who I am.?Cheered on by supporters whose spirits were not dampened by a near-two-hour delay, McGregor goaded the 40-year-old Mayweather with taunts about his age, appearance and rumoured tax bill.He remarked that four years ago he had fought in front of only 400 people at a small venue in London, adding ?this is my first time in a boxing ring and in six weeks I?ll rule boxing?.Mayweather was booed as soon as he took the microphone and endured a hostile reception from the pro-McGregor crowd throughout his performance.?The tour became a verbal battle that people were scoring and I didn?t anticipate it being so back and forth,? McGregor said.?If we are going to score it then let?s do that ? I smoked him on all four rounds.?While the money generated by the clash in Las Vegas is expected to eclipse the previous record held by Mayweather?s victory over Manny Pacquiao, its credibility has been questioned.McGregor, who turned 29 on Friday, is a boxing novice and is facing a man regarded as the finest boxer of his generation.?They call that jealousy. It comes with the territory. This is big for both MMA and the boxing world. This is huge,? Mayweather said.?Every MMA guy is trying to fight a boxer. A fight like this can only happen once in a lifetime. This is a very, very big event. It took more than just myself to make this fight happen, but to make a fight of this magnitude happen I had to be involved.?"

I think driving dangerously which can put another driver at risk - luckily we were going slow - but if we were going fast it could have been a lot worse.

Giles Richards?s race report:

2.36pm BST
14:36

Anyway, a race that lacked the drama and spills and thrills of Baku was nonetheless skilfully won from pole by Bottas, whose lightning start pretty much defined his race, once it was checked out by the stewards and declared legal. He held off another stern challenge from Vettel, who extended his championship lead over Hamilton to 20 points. But Bottas is now only 35 points behind, and you wouldn?t rule him out on current form. Hamilton climbed four places from pole, but couldn?t quite manage the explosive performance needed to get on the podium. Anyway, that?s all from me for now. Stay on the site for Giles Richards? report from the Red Bull Ring and other reaction. Thanks for reading and for your mid-race emails that I didn?t have time to respond to at the time. Bye.

That was a close and absorbing last lap, but it was another fine race by Bottas, who?s creeping up in the title race, but Vettel remains firmly out in front, having stretched his advantage over Hamilton, who did well in the end to come so close to a podium finish after starting from eighth. But he had to settle for fourth place behind Ricciardo, who finishes on the podium for the second race in a row.Updated

Lap 55: This is another test of Bottas?s temperament ? he?s shown he can handle pressure before, but it won?t be easy. As Vettel is told there may be rain before the end of the race, which Hamilton may like too but it?s probably too late.

2.06pm BST
14:06

Lap 53: Quick places recap: 1 Bottas 2 Vettel 3 Ricciardo 4 Hamilton 5 Raikkonen 6 Grosjean 7 Perez 8 Ocon 9 Massa 10 Stroll. A good lap from Hamilton puts him within three and a half seconds of Ricciardo, though Raikkonen is closing on Hamilton too.

2.03pm BST
14:03

Lap 52: Hamilton?s woes will be music to Vettel?s ears in terms of the title race but can he reel in Bottas? He?s closing slowly, and has 19 laps to cut that lead, which is currently around 3.8secs. Updated
at 2.03pm BST


2.02pm BST
14:02

Lap 51: Vettel cuts the gap to 3.8secs on Bottas, as Hamilton complains that ?I?m struggling out here? ? a pit stop would be risky, but Mercedes may need to do something; there?s blistering on his front left tyres too.

14:01

Lap 50: Vettel steps on the gas, reducing the gap to below four seconds ? it?s now 3.9secs ? and it puts more daylight between Vettel and Ricciardo in third. Hamilton is still ahead of Raikkonen; they?re in fourth and fifth respectively.

Lap 45: So Bottas is back in front from Vettel, with Ricciardo third, Hamilton fourth and Raikkonen fifth. Vandoorne has been hit with a drive-through penalty for ignoring blue flags, which probably scuppers his chances of any points. Car problems for Red Bull?s Sainz ? it looks as if he?s going to retire.

1.54pm BST

Lap 44: Bottas closes on Raikkonen, and takes him on into turn four, and passes him. He?s back in front and on those fresh tyres he made that look really easy. Raikkonen pits straight away.

13:51

Lap 42: Bottas pits, and the changeover is a little ponderous, which hands Raikkonen the lead. Vettel is now a bit closer to Bottas in third place. So Raikkonen might tactically stay out even longer to help Vettel, as he?s told on the radio that Hamilton has ?bad balance? and isn?t threatening yet.

1.49pm BST
13:49

Lap 40: Some Hamilton unhappiness with the condition of his right rear tyre, which looks a little blistered. He remains fifth, with Ricciardo in front of him in fourth. Raikkonen is still yet to pit in second place.Updated

However, it rejects what Nehru had written about the 1842 treaty on Ladakh and the drawing of the McMahon line in Simla in 1914, in the same letter in 1959.","Summarise: To support its claim about India's ""trespassing"" at the Sikkim border, Chinese Foreign Ministry today said that first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru ""explicitly recognised"" the 1890 Sikkim-Tibet treaty that Beijing was citing to back its territorial claims.In the same March 22, 1959 letter, Nehru also reminded China of an 1842 treaty on Ladakh and the drawing of the McMahon line in Simla in 1914, which aren't recognised by China.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also claimed that India was ""using the excuse of Bhutan's interests to infringe upon China's territory"" and suggested India had sent its troops into Bhutan without the latter's permission.CHINA'S CHARGE AGAINST INDIA""The Bhutan side does not know previously that Indian troops entered Doklam which is not in line with what India claims,"" said spokesperson Geng Shuang, contradicting India's Friday statement that the Royal Bhutan Army had on June 16 protested the PLA's construction activities in Doklam, with the Indian Army two days later supporting Bhutan and asking China to stop altering the status quo.Citing the 1890 convention which fixes the India-China-Bhutan trijunction at Gipmochi, far south of where India and Bhutan do, the Foreign Ministry said the ""illegal trespass of border troops goes against convention and is against basic principles of the UN Charter and international laws"".""The action taken by India is undoubtedly a betrayal of consistent position held by India,"" said Geng, adding that ""Prime Minister Nehru explicitly recognised the 1890 convention between Tibet and Sikkim"" in a March 22, 1959 letter to the then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.India maintains the 1890 agreement only provides the basis of alignment of the boundary, and that the border needs to be finalized by the Special Representatives in maps and on the ground.In the letter Geng cited, Nehru wrote that ""The boundary of Sikkim, a protectorate of India, with the Tibet Region of China was defined in the Anglo- Chinese Convention 1890 and jointly demarcated on the ground in 1895.""WHAT CHINA DOES NOT MENTIONHowever, in the same letter, Nehru also mentioned agreements on the boundaries in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, which China now rejects.In fact, in the very same section of the letter, Nehru mentioned the following two agreements: ""The Ladakh Region of the State of Jammu and Kashmir- A treaty of 1842 between Kashmir on the one hand and the Emperor of China and Lama Guru of Lhasa on the other, mentions the India-China boundary in the Ladakh region. In 1847 the Chinese Government admitted that this boundary was sufficiently and distinctly fixed. The area now claimed by China has always been depicted as part of India on official maps, has been surveyed by Indian officials and even a Chinese map of shows it as Indian territory.""On the McMahon Line, Nehru wrote: ""The McMahon Line-As you are aware, the so-called McMahon Line runs eastwards from the eastern borders of Bhutan and defines the boundary of China on the one hand and on the India and Burma on the other. Contrary to what has been reported to you, this line was, in fact, drawn at a Tripartite Conference held at Simla in 1913-1914 between the Plenipotentiaries of the Governments of China, Tibet and India. At the time of acceptance of the delineation of this frontier, Lonchen Shatra, the Tibetan Plenipotentiary, in letters exchanged, stated explicitly that he had received orders from Lhasa to agree to the boundary as marked on the map appended to the Convention."" China, however, does not recognise those two treaties.ALSO READ |China will defend territory even at the cost of war with India, says Chinese dailyBeyond Doka La: 10 irritants in India-China relationChina says 1890 treaty backs claims to Doklam plateau at trijunction"
"The Centre has rejected Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's request to provide flood relief assistance to the state and has instead directed the Bihar government to spend its State Disaster Response Fund first.

This time the bone of contention is the flood relief assistance which Bihar government has sought from the Centre to deal with aftermath of massive floods that hit the state this year. The Centre rejecting the request made by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to provide flood relief assistance to the state to deal with the post-flood situation has directed the Bihar government to first spend the funds it has under State Disaster Fund before seeking any kind of central assistance.It may be noted that the Bihar government at present has Rs 1,859 crore in the State Disaster Fund and the Centre has directed it to spend this amount first as relief and rehabilitation for flood victims and compensation to farmers for crop losses.

"A former senior executive at online media startup ScoopWhoop has filed FIR against Co-founder Suparn Pandey accusing him of sexual harassment and assault. The complainant accused Pandey of making inappropriate remarks, sending her a lewd video, being uncomfortably close and publicly commenting on her sexuality. She also accused other Co-founders of abetting harassment and trying to conceal it.","Summarise: After a series of allegations on social media from several women complaining of sexual harassment, Mumbai Police registered an FIR against CEO and founder of The Viral Fever, Arunabh Kumar. He came out and addressed the accusations made against him and said ""I am a heterosexual, single man and when I find a woman sexy, I tell her she's sexy. I compliment women. Is that wrong?"". The comment obviously did not help his case and he faced massive backlash for the same. After the incident, there were various debates and discussions on work place ethics and sexual harassment. Almost 15 days later, another similar incident has come to light. An FIR has been filed against ScoopWhoop co-founder Suparn Pandey accusing him of sexual harassment and sexual assault, as reported by Catch News.  Along with Suparn Pandey, other co-founders have also been named though for abetting harassment and trying to conceal it.A former senior executive of ScoopWhoop Media Pvt. Ltd filed the FIR at the Vasant Kunj (South) police Station, Delhi. The accused has been charged with section 354 A (sexual harassment), section 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman), and section 506 (criminal intimidation), reported Catch News. Â The complainant has claimed that during her tenure at ScoopWhoop, which lasted two years, she faced 'inappropriate comments and lewd remarks' the entire time. Pandey even went on to comment on her sexuality. ""Mr. Suparn Pandey in public commented on my sexuality and this comment included calling me a names (sic.) which reflected on my sexual orientation and my sexual preferences (sic.) as well as characterised me in a certain way"", states the FIR according to a Catch News report .Â Her ordeal was not limited to verbal harassment, the complainant has claimed that Pandey repeatedly got 'uncomfortably close', 'often trying to play with her hair' . He unabashedly even sent her a lewd video on the company's official Gmail chat, the FIR alleges. 'Mr. Pandey got so bold as to send me a lewd video over the official Gmail chat, in which the words were ""aapnu jeans dheeli karo""', reads the FIR. ScoopWhoop's inactionWhen the complainant, took up the matter with ScoopWhoop co-founder Sriparna Tikekar, she assured her that such behaviour would not be repeated. However, apparently she did not take any action against Pandey. The former senior executive did not stop raising the issue with the company's founders even after realising that it had no repercussions for Pandey. She was instead publicly humilated and was allegedly forced to work in close quarters with Pandey. If she was refused, she was ""reprimanded and humiliated"".Suparn Pandey used to show up to work drunk and would try to touch the complainant. She decided to quit after Pandey crossed all limits. 'Mr. Pandey approached me after the meeting, between 8-9:30PM, when I was alone at my work desk and asked me to be less ""aggressive"" in my dealings with other people and learn to ""pour some sugar on it."" That after that, he then got up, kissed my forehead and walked away,' the complainant recounts in the FIR .Â  She was allegedly dissuaded from lodging a formal complaint and the co-founders threatened to hurt her career and defame her publicly. Following a series of complaints and threats, she resigned from ScoopWhoop. "

"According to a study Jews are the most educated religious group in the world, with an average of 13.4 years of schooling and majority going on to pursue higher education. Meanwhile, Hindus and Muslims have the fewest years of formal schooling, with an average of 5.6 years. Notably, adults with no religious affiliation spend 8.8 years in school on average.","Summarise: Jews are better educated than any other major religious group in the world, with an average of 13.4 years of schooling and a majority going on to higher education, a study has found.At the other end of the educational scale, Hindus and Muslims have the fewest years of formal schooling, with an average of 5.6 years.The main reason for the disparity is that Jews are largely concentrated in Israel and the US, countries with high levels of education generally, whereas 98% of the world?s Hindus live in the developing countries of India, Nepal and Bangladesh.Among Muslims, those that live in countries with strong economies are well-educated, but those who live in developing regions have comparatively short periods of formal schooling ? and girls fare worse than boys.But there are also notable differences between religious groups in the same areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where Christians are generally better educated than Muslims.The study, Religion and Education Around the World, was published on Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center.It found that, compared with the Jewish average of more than 13 years of formal schooling, Christians had 9.3 years, Buddhists 7.9, and Muslims and Hindus 5.6. Adults with no religious affiliation spend 8.8 years in school on average.Almost one in five of all adults ? more than 680 million people ? received no formal schooling, but for Muslims and Hindus, the number missing out on education rose to around two in five.However, in recent years the amount of time spent at school has increased among all groups.According to Pew, the youngest Hindus in the study (born between 1976 and 1985) spent an average of 7.1 years in school ? nearly twice as long as the oldest Hindus (born between 1936 and 1955).Within three generations, Muslims, similarly, were spending an extra three years at school, with an extra 2.5 years for Buddhists. Over the same period, Christians gained just an extra year and Jews less than half a year.Among religiously unaffiliated adults, the youngest had an extra 2.9 years in school, overtaking Christians for the number of school years for this age group.Pew found similar changes when looking at the educational gender gap. Although overall a much higher proportion of women had received no formal education, and those that had generally spent fewer years in school, the gap was shrinking with successive generations.But among Hindus, there was still an 18-point gap between the youngest men and women, with 38% of women having no formal education compared with 20% of men.The gender gap among the youngest Muslims was 10 points, with 33% of women not going to school compared with 23% of men.The religiously unaffiliated had closed the gap within three generations, although there were still 2% of men and women having no formal education.In higher education, Jews strikingly reversed the gender gap. In the youngest group, 69% of women have degrees compared with 57% of men ? reversing a seven-point gap in favour of men among the oldest Jews to a 12-point gap in favour of women. Christians and the religiously unaffiliated also reversed gaps but to a lesser extent.The report emphasises the difference in education between people in economically developed areas and those in poorer, less developed ones, regardless of religion. Among the factors affecting education levels are socioeconomic conditions, armed conflict, child labour and child marriage.Christians in Europe and North America tend to be much more highly educated than those in sub-Saharan Africa.Hindus have relatively low levels of education in India, Bangladesh and Nepal ? but in the US, 96% have college degrees, a higher share than any other major religious group.In general, religious minorities in the US are more likely to have college degrees than the Christian majority (Hindus 96%, Jews 75%, Muslims 54%, Buddhists 53%, unaffiliated 44%, Christians 36%).In sub-Saharan Africa, Muslims are more than twice as likely as Christians to have no formal schooling ? and the gap is widening.The report says: ?Some scholars suggest that the source of the Christian-Muslim attainment gap is rooted in the location of Christian missionary activity during colonial times. Missionary-built educational facilities were often located in what became heavily Christian areas rather than predominantly Muslim locales ? As a result, Christians gained an educational edge over Muslims that lasted decades.?"

"The Centre informed the Lok Sabha there is no proposal in consideration to scrap Sahayak or buddy system in the Army. This comes after several jawans voiced their outrage against the system saying they are treated like servants by senior officers. Notably, under Sahayak system, a jawan is attached to officers and their duties include protecting and helping the officers.","Summarise: New Delhi, Jul 28 (PTI) No proposal is under consideration to scrap the Sahayak system in the Army, the government today said, notwithstanding rising cases of jawans coming out openly against the colonial-era provision. The clarification by Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre came in the Lok Sabha in response to a question. ""No proposal for scrapping the Sahayak system, presently in place in the Army, is under consideration in the Ministry at present,"" he said, in a brief written reply. Under the Sahayak or buddy system, a solider is attached to officers and their duties include protecting the officers, maintaining their weapons and equipment and helping them in carrying out their responsibilities. Last month, a senior Army official had said that the force is actively considering recruiting civilian staff in peace stations to do away with the Sakayak system. Earlier this year, a number of videos had surfaced where some army jawans were seen voicing their anger over the Sahayak system with some even alleging that they are treated as servants by the officers whom they are attached to. To a separate question, Bhamre said complaints by serving soldiers are dealt with by authorities concerned according to existing rules and policies. He said a study conducted by the Defence Institute of Psychological Research concluded that the major causes of suicides in the Army are domestic problems, marital discord, stress and financial problems.

"While the Supreme Court upheld four Nirbhaya gangrape convicts' death penalty, the juvenile convict in the case now works as a cook at a dhaba in South India. The exact location of his place of work has not been disclosed, fearing a threat to his life. The juvenile was released in 2015, after completing the three-year sentence awarded to him.","Summarise: Away from the limelight on the verdict in the December 16 gang-rape and murder, the ?juvenile? convicted in the case, who was found guilty of raping and killing the 23-year-old physiotherapist on December 16, 2012 ? has settled well in his new life. He is cooking at a prominent restaurant. The minor has turned 23 years old now.?He was always worried about getting lynched and that is why he was sent to the southern part of the country. Now, the verdict has come, focus will again move to him but he is at a place where he might not even see the national news channels. His employer is not aware of his past and even he has left it behind,? said a NGO official, who was part of his rehabilitation process. The officer, however, refused to reveal any further details fearing safety of the ?juvenile?. A year after he walked free, he was employed at a dhaba in south India. ?After his release on December 20, 2015, he was kept with an NGO for a few days. Later, the NGO rehabilitated him to the southern part of the country. He is currently employed as cook at a restaurant,? he said. The officer said that not many are aware of his background. He was 11 when he fled home, 240 km from Delhi. His elder sister single-handedly fends for the family of six ? ailing mother, younger siblings and bedridden father.

On that night too, they asked him to accompany them.During his time at the shelter, he used to call his mother often, said an official.A number of welfare officers and a counsellor, who spoke to him at the correction home, told HT that he was the most disciplined inmate.They say soon after coming to the shelter, he turned religious. He grew a beard and started offering namaz five times a day. Initially, he was kept away from the other inmates. But during the last year of his stay, he shared the dormitory with a high court blast accused.?This led many to believe that he was radicalised. So he was shifted to a separate room. He had little interest in studies and the only thing he learnt was to write his name. Cooking is his passion and he was always there to give a final touch to dishes prepared by the staff. Inmates often demanded food cooked by him,? the officer added.However, intelligence bureau still keeps a watch on him.?He was a victim of circumstances. When I got a chance to meet him, I found him sad the way his role was portrayed in the incident. He was pushed into child labour at the age of 9 and worked at hazardous sectors. He is leading a Normal life, which all he wanted,? said Amod Kanth, chairperson of Prayas, an NGO who runs a home in Feroz Shah kotla, where his trial was conducted."

"Japanese electronics maker Sony has unveiled the 'Xperia XZ Premium', the world's first smartphone with 4K HDR display at ?46,700. The phone's 19-megapixel camera has a memory-stacked sensor, making it world's first smartphone camera that records slow motion video at 960 frames per second. The device runs on Android Nougat and has 4 GB RAM and 64 GB inbuilt storage.","Summarise: Hot on the heels of Nokia, LG and Huawei's, Sony has unveiled their latest Xperia flagship Smartphone - the Xperia XZ Premium at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona. The Xperia XZ Premium is undoubtedly the company's most exciting device in years and comes with a range of breakthrough features, the chief amongst them being the world's first 4K HDR display in a smartphone.Â Unlike the LG G6, which has eschewed Qualcomm's latest processor - the Snapdragon 835 in favour of the older Snapdragon 821 in order to gain the first mover advantage over the Galaxy S8, Sony has decided to stick with the 835 for the XZ Premium.The catch here is the fact that the XZ Premium will not be out before Spring, which is quite some time away. Additionally, the smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM, a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support and Android 7.0 out of the box. As with previous Xperia's, the power button doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. Also Read:  Nokia 3310 relaunched: What is its price and other questions answeredTouted as a 'game-changing camera', the Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with an entirely new camera system called the 'Motion Eye' which comes with the world's first memory stacked sensor. Sony has embedded fast memory right into the camera stack which allows the smartphone to capture video at an astonishing 960 frames per second, which is 4 times slower than any other smartphone available today. Sony claims that the ' World's fastest image capture technology in a smartphone' allows the camera to capture instances that occur in the blink of an eye and reveal things beyond what the human vision is capable of seeing. The added memory also brings with it improved predictive capture in the XZ Premium. The device starts to buffer images the moment it detects motion and selects 4 of the best photos by analysing the speed of the moving object.Additionally, the XZ Premium also comes with the same triple-sensor system found in the Xperia XZ, although the sensor's resolution has been reduced slightly to 19 megapixels. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and comes with SteadyShot and an 'Anti-distortion' shutter. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 for selfies.Along with the camera, the display is what sets the XZ Premium apart from the competition. It is the first smartphone in the world to come with a 4K HDR display which is 5.5' in size and is also 40% brighter than the Xperia Z5 Premium's panel.The problem with the Xperia Z5 Premium was the fact that there was little or no 4K content available to enjoy on the smartphone. To remedy this, Sony has entered into a partnership with Amazon Prime Video where users will be able to enjoy a selection of 4K HDR content on their smartphones.Lastly, Sony has entered into a partnership with Qualcomm in order to create a new class of devices that are capable of gigabit LTE speeds. The XZ Premium will be the first smartphone to feature the same and offer not only high speeds but much better speeds everywhere. "
"Microsoft has announced its long-standing basic graphics editing program 'MS Paint' will no longer be available with the next Windows 10 update called the Autumn Creators Update. The program was first released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985. MS Paint's removal is a part of Microsoft's plan to shut programs that are ""not in active development.""","Summarise: Microsoft?s next Windows 10 update, called the Autumn (or Fall in the US) Creators Update, will bring a variety of new features. But one long-standing stalwart of the Windows experience has been put on the chopping block: Microsoft Paint.First released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985, Paint in its various guises would be one of the first graphics editors used by many and became a core part of Windows. Starting life as a 1-bit monochrome licensed version of ZSoft?s PC Paintbrush, it wasn?t until Windows 98 that Paint could save in JPEG.With the Windows 10 Creators Update, released in April, Microsoft introduced the new Paint 3D, which is installed alongside traditional Paint and features 3D image making tools as well as some basic 2D image editing. But it is not an update to original Paint and doesn?t behave like it.Now Microsoft has announced that, alongside Outlook Express, Reader app and Reading list, Microsoft Paint has been signalled for death having been added to the ?features that are removed or deprecated in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update? list.Falling under the deprecated column for apps that are ?not in active development and might be removed in future releases?, Microsoft Paint?s ticket has been called and now it?s only a matter of time before it is removed like your favourite piece of old furniture from your childhood home.Paint was never one of the most capable apps, and was limited to the bitmap (BMP) and PCX formats until 1998, but if you wanted to scribble something out using your mouse or make a quick cut and paste job, Paint was always there, even on work computers.The most recent version of Paint for Windows 7 and later was much improved, but still considered feature poor compared to other free alternatives such as the third-party Paint.NET.When Microsoft Paint will officially be removed from Windows has yet to be confirmed, while a precise date for the release of the Windows 10 Autumn Creators Update is equally up in the air. Whether, like Clippy, Windows users will celebrate or decry Paint?s removal, it will be a moment in the history of Windows as one of its longest-standing apps is put out to pasture."

"The Centre on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that it may enact a new law to provide jail terms or fines for heads of NGOs which misappropriate government funds or do not file annual statements.

Criminal proceedings for misappropriation and civil action for recovery of given funds must be initiated. ""Rs950 crore is being given in total to all NGOs every year. This is a phenomenal amount... tax payers money ... since 78 ministries and departments were granting money to NGOs, a law on regulating funds and work by NGOs would be much better. Inform us in eight weeks whether you want to streamline NGOs through guidelines or through legislation,"" the bench had told the government.The SC order came after senior lawyer Amucus Dwivedi cited a CBI report that said only 10 per cent of NGOs filed annual income and expenditure statements.

"A BJP MP has moved a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha, seeking reservation of five seats in the Lok Sabha and one in the Rajya Sabha for residents of Gilgit and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) regions. The MP expects the bill to be taken up during the second phase of the Budget Session of Parliament starting from March 9.","Summarise: A BJP MP has moved a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha, seeking reservation of five seats in the Lower House as well as one in the Rajya Sabha for residents of Gilgit and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) regions. ""It is a matter of extreme surprise that the Lower House does not take into account this territory, whereas the State Legislature of Jammu and Kashmir keeps 25 seats vacant for the territory which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan,"" said Nishikant Dubey, who has piloted the bill. ""It would be proper that seats provided for the Jammu and Kashmir area, which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan, in the Lok Sabha are kept vacant as elections can not be held in these areas,"" he said. Dubey expects the bill to be taken up during the second phase of the Budget Session of Parliament starting from March 9. INSERTION OF NEW ARTICLE 370AThe Legislation asks for an insertion of new Article 370A, after Article 370, in the Constitution of India, to add five Lok Sabha seats and one Rajya Sabha seat. However, these seats would be kept vacant as elections can not be held in these areas. At the same time, these seats shall not be taken into account for reckoning the total membership of both houses and the said area shall be excluded in delimiting the territorial constituencies, the bill proposes. Dubey had tried twice to introduce this private member's bill, once in November 2014 and in February 2015 again, but on both occasions Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha disallowed it. ""I will approach all the members and try to build a consensus on this landmark legislation,"" Dubey said, adding that the purpose behind moving this legislation is to highlight the atrocities committed by Pakistan in these areas. Time has come to correct the mistake that is being carried out from 1950s, he added. "

"Outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee had discontinued the term 'His Excellency' earlier used to address Presidents, during his tenure as the 13th President of the country. He instead asked the word 'Hon'ble' to be added before a designation. Further, he had also directed authorities to organise maximum events inside the Rashtrapati Bhavan to reduce inconvenience caused to the police and people.","Summarise: President Pranab Mukherjee will demit office on Tuesday, making way for Ram Nath Kovind as the 14th incumbent on the top constitutional post. Though Mukherjee would exit Rashtrapati Bhavan, his contributions as president would be remembered for a long time to come.Pranab Mukherjee did not just confine himself to being a copy president. He took several initiatives in several spheres of life which would go a long way to inspire several generations to come.1. DEMOCRATISATION OF PRESIDENCYThe Rashtrapati Bhavan, on the first anniversary of Pranab Mukherjee's term, made a number of announcements in a bid to democratise the institution of presidency. It did away with the honorific 'His Excellency' used to address the president. Governors of states were also encouraged to follow the practice.The protocol and security restrictions on guests invited to Rashtrapati Bhavan were relaxed to the maximum extent possible.Pranab Mukherjee's predecessors would take part in several activities in different parts of the capital. But these would inconvenience the common man. To avoid this, a decision was taken to have as many functions as possible within the Rashtrapati Bhavan itself in order to avoid disruption of traffic and any inconvenience to public.2. ORDINANCES AND MERCY PETITIONSPranab Mukherjee promulgated or re-promulgated 26 ordinances during his tenure. In the fifth year, he promulgated five ordinances.In the same period, he commuted four mercy petitions and rejected 30, second only to R Venkatraman, who rejected 45 mercy pleas.KR Narayanan and his successor Abdul Kalam came to be known for sitting on mercy petitions. Narayanan, in fact, did not act upon a single mercy petition sent to him. Kalam cleared two petitions during his tenure, commuting one and rejecting the other.On the other hand, President Pranab Mukherjee's immediate predecessor Pratibha Patil earned the reputation of being one of India's most lenient heads of state. She commuted saw 34 pleas and rejected five.3. TEACHER PRANAB MUKHERJEEPresident Pranab Mukherjee also created a record of sorts by becoming the first head of state to teach school children. During the last two years of his presidency, he did what he used to do over 50 years ago - teach. He held classes at a school within the premises of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Mukherjee, a Master's degree holder in history, political science and law, taught about 80 students of classes 11 and 12 at the Rajendra Prasad Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in the President's Estate. He imparted lesson to students on the history of Indian politics. He also spoke about the rising menace of terrorism in the country and outside.4. RASHTRAPATI BHAVAN ON TWITTERThe Rashtrapati Bhavan's Twitter account was launched on July 1, 2014 to connect directly with the public and disseminate information on the President's activities. The account gained about 102,000 followers in 20 days. As President Pranab Mukherjee demits office, Rashtrapati Bhavan has 3,297,391 followers on Twitter.5. MUSEUMA new museum in a heritage building - the Carriage Halls and the Stables - earlier used for horses and to house buggies, has been converted into a state-of-the-art museum. It highlights landmark events starting from Delhi Durbar of 1911 to the oath taking by first President Rajendra Prasad. The museum also displays a part of the collection of arms, some furniture fashioned by Lutyens, activities of the President's Body Guard and a rich collection of gifts offered to the President by Indian and foreign dignitaries.

"After Indian captain Virat Kohli accused some of the Australian players of trolling Indian team's physio Patrick Farhart, an Australian daily called Kohli as the Donald Trump of world sport. ""Just like President Trump, Kohli decided to blame the media as a means of trying to hide the egg smeared right across his face,"" the article added.","Summarise: The Australian media has made a scathing accusation on India captain Virat Kohli of being ""completely untouchable"" and ""a law unto himself"". The Daily Telegraph compared Kohli to the United States President Donald Trump, saying ""Kohli has become the Donald Trump of world sport"".This comes after Kohli accused the Australian players of trolling Team India physio Patrick Farhart during the Ranchi Test.""They (four-five of them) started taking Patrick's name. I don't know why. He's our physio. His job is to treat me. I don't find the reason behind it. I could not understand. You must ask why they have started taking his name,"" Kohli said.Â While saving a run on the first day of the third Test, Kohli hurt his right shoulder and Farhart rushed onto the field to attain to his injury. Kohli eventually left the field with the physio and was back in action only on the third day.Later, Glenn Maxwell was seen mocking Kohli's injury when he imitated his action by clutching his right shoulder after his dive to save a boundary. The Indian skipper, too, gave it back with a similar gesture when David Warner got out in Australia's second innings.However, Smith insisted that they never disrespected Farhart, who himself is an Australian.""Virat was having a go at me out in the middle and saying how I was disrespecting Patrick Farhart when actually it was the exact opposite. If I was to do anything, (I was inferring) he did a pretty terrific job to get Virat back on the field after that shoulder,"" Smith said.DRS SAGAThe Kohli-Smith quarrel started in Bengaluru over a DRS incident when the Australian captain was caught seeking help from his team's dressing room over a review after he was trapped leg before by Umesh Yadav.While Smith called it a ""brain fade"", Kohli warned the visitors of ""crossing the line"". International Cricket Council put an end to the saga by not pressing charges against Smith or Kohli.""Test captains, under the rules of the game, are supposed to be the flagbearers for upholding the spirit of the game, yet the ICC has allowed the Indian captain to destroy one of the foundations on which the game has been played for more than a century,"" The Daily Telegraph wrote.""The fact Kohli has not been sanctioned for calling the Australians systematic cheats or his latest unfounded attack on Smith shows that he is completely untouchable.""""The ICC won't fine him. Not even the BCCI, who through their broadcaster apologised to Smith, can get their skipper to tow the party line.""'KOHLI DISRESPECTS GAME'The report further compared Kohli to Arjuna Ranatunga for showing no respect to his opponent.""Like former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, Kohli relies on a flagrant disrespect of his opponents and the game to fuel himself and his team.Soft cricketing administrators have given rise to a bat-wielding Trump.""'KOHLI, AUSTRALIA'S NO.1 ENEMY'There's no doubt that Australian fans hate Kohli. India and Australia contests have always seen sparks flying, be it ""Monkeygate"" or Ricky Ponting playing an umpire on the field or Kohli's finger gesture to the Sydney crowd during his first tour Down Under."

"Actor Vivek Oberoi has said that if his phone still rings to inform about work for him in films, he feels successful. Speaking about his films which didn't perform well at the box-office, he said, ""If I start spending time analysing my choices, I won't be able to live my life."" Vivek added that success or failure is very relative.","Summarise: Actor Vivek Oberoi started off his career on a high note with the film Company (2002). He established himself as the new heartthrob in Bollywood, after the romantic drama Saathiya (2002).

Success or failure is very relative. If I believe had I failed after Shootout At Lokhandwala (2007),  then I wouldn?t have been around. I wouldn?t have had success with films such as Grand Masti, Krrish 3 or Prince. I wouldn?t be around at all. For me, a simplistic way of looking at life was that if my phone still rings and the other person says that ?I have a role for you in my film? I am successful,? he says.The actor, who has experimented with various genres and roles, does not believe in categorising his work. ? I have never believed that characters are negative or positive, white or grey. Shade cards are for paints, not for actors. Anything that I find interesting, I become that person and then it?s done,? says the actor, who currently stars in a web series.In his career spanning over 15 years, the actor, who made his debut with Company, never found it difficult to portray different roles. ?The minute I am off camera, I am done. In the initial stages of my career I did a lot of experiments. I did Company and lived in slums for it and researched.

All that just changed with Evita Delmundo auditioning for Miss Universe Malaysia.Evita, hailing from Sabah in north-eastern Malaysia, has been in focus recently for entering her application for the global competition.

"A support of 122 MLAs is needed to form the government in the 243-seat Bihar Assembly. Nitish Kumar, who will face the floor test on Friday, has the backing of JD(U)'s 71 MLAs, BJP's 53 MLAs, and other NDA partners' 5 MLAs. Apart from that, two independent MLAs have extended support to the new alliance, taking the total to 131.","Summarise: Within 18 hours of resigning as Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar took oath on Thursday as the head of the government for the sixth time with the BJP?s Sushil Kumar Modi as his deputy.He will seek a trust vote on Friday after re-forging a partnership with the BJP, four years after he walked out of the NDA.His surprise resignation sank the three-party ?grand alliance? of his Janata Dal (United), Lalu Prasad?s Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress that defeated the BJP in the 2015 state elections.Kumar?s switch upset several leaders of the JD(U) as well, including parliamentarians and local unit heads. Sharad Yadav, who led the party before Kumar, is also said to be displeased with the chief minister?s ?unilateral decisions?. RJD chief Prasad accused Kumar of cheating the people of Bihar and said in Ranchi he could challenge in the Supreme Court the governor?s action of disallowing his party, the single largest with 80 legislators, to stake claim to form a new government.Numbers seems to favour Kumar. The JD(U) has 71 MLAs, the BJP 53, other NDA partners five. Besides, two of the four independents have backed the NDA, making a bloc of 131, which is nine more than the majority mark in the 243-member assembly.The RJD-led grouping has 107 members, including the Congress?s 27. Two independents and three CPI-ML members are unattached.Law experts believe a legal fight against Kumar may fall flat as the Goa and Manipur instances proved this year. The Congress won more seats in both states in the 2017 state elections, but the BJP tied together bigger combinations. The top court dismissed the Congress?s challenge.They said Bihar governor KN Tripathi?s action was not illegal.?After a crisis the concept of who has the larger and a stable combination comes. So the governor has the discretion to call a combination or party who will enjoy majority on the floor of the House,? senior advocate Rajeev Dhawan said.Governor Tripathi, who was admitted to hospital on Wednesday when the political drama played out in Patna, returned to Raj Bhavan and administered the oath to Kumar at 10am.The cabinet would be expanded after Friday?s vote, sources said.Sources said the JD(U) could get a ministerial position in the Narendra Modi government during a reshuffle planned after Parliament?s monsoon session. The move would make the ?alliance? complete at the Centre and the state, and check rumblings within the party. JD(U) leaders, including Rajya Sabha members Ali Anwar and Veerendra Kumar, attempted to persuade Sharad Yadav on Thursday to take the lead to oppose Kumar for allegedly not taking the party into confidence.Veerendra Kumar said: ?He (Sharad Yadav) told me there is no question of accepting the current stand of Nitish Kumar.?Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi also criticised Kumar for dumping the grand alliance and joining the BJP.?The mandate was against the communal stand of the BJP but Nitish has chosen to embrace them. We were aware of what was going on for three-four months. This is the problem with Indian politics. For the sake of power and personal gains, they compromise with anything.?BSP chief Mayawati accused Kumar of betraying the people of Bihar. ?Democracy will be weakened. This is another example of hunger for power.?For his part, Kumar thanked Prime Minister Modi for his congratulatory message after being sworn-in. He said his administration would not compromise on corruption and was hopeful that Bihar?s development agenda would gather momentum with the Centre?s support.Kumar?s decision to quit came hours after the RJD chief ruled out the resignation of his son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi, who is facing an investigation over an alleged land-for-hotels scandal.Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary told reporters that in view of the trust vote, a day-long special sitting of the assembly has been convened on Friday.The BJP sent party secretary Anil Jain and health minister JP Nadda to the swearing-in.Nadda said: ?Kumar?s step is courageous and will send a positive message against corruption ... We will contribute to the state?s development with him.?The Kumar-Modi reunion makes the BJP-led NDA?s bid to retain power in the 2019 general election stronger. The BJP and its allies rule 12 states that send 20 or more MPs to the Lok Sabha.The opposition?s attempts at forging a united front against the NDA took a hard hit after the exit of Kumar, identified with good governance and probity.?Who will be key faces in any such opposition front in 2019? Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Mamata Banerjee, Lalu Prasad? None of them can corner us on the issue of corruption or good governance. Nitish was a different matter,? a BJP leader said.(with agency inputs)"

""I think if they wanted me to, I would love to be the mediator or arbitrator.""Haley was answering a question from a reporter at her news conference on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for the month of April.The reporter pointed out that India does not want an interlocutor for talks with Pakistan, while Islamabad wanted the US or another country to facilitate talks between them and asked if the US would get the leaders of the two countries to talk.With Secretary of State Rex Tillerson keeping a low public profile and generally avoiding the media, Haley is emerging as the public face of US diplomacy making her presence felt in the media aided by her cabinet status.Her statement about India-Pakistan relations, therefore, assume importance and it is the first high-level Trump administration statement on India's relations with Pakistan.While it is not clear what steps the US could take, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet Trump in Washington in May when the two could discuss it."

Four persons were arrested by Gurugram Police for allegedly cloning debit and credit cards of customers at PVR cinemas in two malls on MG Road. The accused allegedly cloned around 45 to 50 cards and stole up to ?25 lakh from customers. They reportedly took note of ATM PIN numbers and used it to withdraw cash from the cloned cards. ,"Summarise: Four persons, including three former employees of PVR cinemas in Gurgaon, were arrested by Gurgaon police for allegedly cloning credit and debit cards of customers who visited the theatres. The accused are suspected to have cloned around 45 to 50 cards of customers and siphoned off an amount of Rs20 to Rs25 lakhs of customers who visited the theatres located on two malls on MG Road, the police said on Friday.The accused have been identified as Ajay Raghav, Sanjay Jat, Rahul Yadav and Sonajeet. They took note of ATM pin numbers of customers and later used it to withdraw cash from the cards cloned by them. Raghav, Jat, and Yadav worked in the mulitplexes.Two ATM card readers, one card cloning machine, one laptop and few cloned cards were recovered from the accused. The accused have been sent on three days police remand for further questioning. The machines are easily available online at a very low price, police said.A few days earlier, a similar racket was unearthed in?Delhi where an employee of Farzi cafe in Connaught Place was caught by police for cloning cards. Sumit Kuhar, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said that Ajay Raghav, a resident of Mathura in UP,?was the kingpin of the gang and was arrested from Mathura.?Raghav got to know that police was after him so he had shifted his accommodation. He is married and used the stolen money for family?s expenses,? said Kuhar. Raghav?s arrest and unraveling of the gang came after a Gurgaon resident Dhrishti Bhasin complained at Sector 56 police station that someone had withdrawn Rs50,000 from her account using a debit card on May 25.The matter was referred to the Cyber crime cell, which formed a team under cell in-charge inspector Anand Kumar that started identifying the ATMs from where the cash was being withdrawn.?After sustained investigation, the police was able to identify Sanjay Jat, a resident from Alwar in Rajasthan, and arrested him from his brother?s house in south city 2,? said Kuhar.On questioning, Jat spilled the beans and this led to the arrest of others including Raghav, Sonajeet who lives in DLF phase 4, and Rahul Yadav who is from Kosli in Rewari. It is being suspected that there are more members involved in the fraud, who used to steal ATM pin numbers from different locations. Police is also on the look out of a person, who had taught card cloning to Jat, which led to his entry into this trade.The accused have been arrested in a case registered at sector 56 police station under section 379 (theft), 420 (fraud), and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and section 66 of the IT Act.A representative of the PVR cinemas said that officials authorised to speak to the media were not available."
"A Delhi judge noted the difference in punishment for killing cows and people, while sentencing a man for causing death by rash driving. ?The sentence for killing cow is five, seven, or 14 years in different states, but the sentence for causing the death of a human being through rash or negligent driving is only two years,? he said.","Summarise: When a Delhi judge sentenced the son of a Haryana-based industrialist to two years? imprisonment on Saturday for mowing down a motorcyclist with his luxury car in 2008, he couldn?t help but observe how present-day laws provide more stringent punishment to perpetrators of cattle-related crimes than errant drivers who take human lives. ?The sentence for killing cow is five, seven or 14 years in different states, but the sentence for causing the death of a human being through rash or negligent driving is only two years,? additional sessions judge Sanjeev Kumar said.The court held the accused, 30-year-old Utsav Bhasin, guilty of rash driving, voluntarily causing hurt on provocation and causing death by negligence. It also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh for the injured.On the night of September 11, 2008, Bhasin ? then a BBA student ? had crushed Anuj Chauhan and his friend, Mrigank Srivastava, under his BMW car at Moolchand in South Delhi. While Chauhan died in a city hospital, Srivastava survived the accident. Bhasin was arrested from ISBT Kashmere Gate while he was fleeing to Chandigarh.Though the court had passed the verdict in May, the quantum of punishment was pronounced only on Saturday. It also granted statutory bail to Bhasin, enabling him to file an appeal in the high court. The bail bond was fixed at Rs 50,000 with surety of a similar amount.Bhasin was earlier cleared of culpable homicide, which provides for a maximum jail term of up to 10 years.The court said a copy of the judgment must be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so he can consider steps to enhance the punishment prescribed for such offences under section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code. The judge also quoted a song from the movie Jindagi aur Toofan ? which goes ?Aadmi chahe toh taqdeer badal sakte hai, poori duniya ki woh tasveer badal sakte hai, aadmi soch toh le uska irada kya hai (Humankind can change its fate if it wants to, can change the entire picture of the world if it wants to, as long as there is a strong resolve to do so)? ? to buttress his point.The court noted that India has a ?disreputable record of road accidents?, with a total of 4.64 lakh road accidents being reported in 2015 alone."
Actor Rishi Kapoor revealed that he was two-years-old when he first started taking 'bribes'. He explained that he was not ready to do a scene in his father Raj Kapoor's film 'Shree 420' and it was a chocolate bribe by Nargis Dutt that convinced him to do it. He said this during a session at the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival.,"Summarise: Jaipur, Jan 20 (PTI) Actor Rishi Kapoor has revealed he was not ready to do a scene in his father Raj Kapoors ""Shree 420"" and it was a chocolate bribe by Nargis Dutt that convinced him to do it. During a session at the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF), the 64-year-old actor, who has recently released his autobiography ""Khullam Khula"", said he was two when he accepted his first bribe. ""I had to give a shot and it was raining that day. It was difficult for crew to make me prepare for the shot. I had just to walk without any expression. It was Nargis who came up with the idea to offer me chocolate to get the shot done. In that sense, I started taking bribes when I was two-year-old,"" Rishi said. However, the actor dodged the question on buying an award for his hit ""Bobby"", something which he has mentioned in his book. ""It is better you read my autobiography."" Rishi candidly talked about his ups and downs in his 44-year-old career in the film industry. ""After the success of Bobby, expectation rose and it became difficult for me to compete with contemporary actors,"" he said. ""It seems that it is easy for star sons to become a hit hero but after your first film you have to cross the journey alone. I had to struggle in different ways."" He left the audience in splits by revealing that he filled several pages with autographs when he heard his parents talking about his launch in films. When asked about which of his acting roles he likes the most, he said that it is now that he has started getting acting roles. ""In the last 25 years, I fooled people by doing romantic roles.

"The government has planned to change security features of ?2,000 and ?500 banknotes every 3-4 years in accordance with the global standards to keep a check on counterfeiting. The move came after fake currency notes were recovered post demonetisation. The security features in newly introduced notes are same as that of old notes, the MHA officials have said.","Summarise: To check counterfeiting, the government plans to change security features of higher denomination banknotes of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 every 3-4 years in accordance with global standards. The move comes in the wake of recovery of a large amount of fake Indian currency notes in last four months after demonetisation.The issue was discussed threadbare at a high-level meeting on Thursday attended by senior officials of the ministries of finance and home, including Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi.Advocating the move, Home Ministry officials said most of the developed countries change security features of their currency notes every 3-4 years and therefore, it is absolutely necessary for India to follow this policy.DECISION LONG DUEThe change in design of Indian currency notes of higher denominations was long due. Till its demonetisation, there had been no major change in the Rs 1,000 note since its introduction in 2000. Changes in the old Rs 500 note, which was launched in 1987, were carried out more than a decade ago.The newly introduced notes had no additional security features and were similar to those in the old Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, officials said.11 OF 17 SECURITY FEATURES REPLICATEDA close look by the investigators on some of the recently seized fake notes found that at least 11 of the 17 security features in the new Rs 2,000 notes had been replicated.These included the transparent area, watermark, Ashoka Pillar emblem, the letters Rs 2000 on the left, the guarantee clause with the Reserve Bank of India Governors signature and the denomination number in Devanagari on the front, officials said.Besides, the motif of Chandrayaan, the Swachh Bharat logo and the year of printing had been copied on the reverse side. Although the print and paper quality of the seized counterfeits was poor, they resembled genuine notes.The officials said the change of security features of currency notes in every 3-4 years will lead to curbing of counterfeiting to a great extent.Those who were arrested recently along with fake notes with face value of Rs 2,000 have told investigators that the notes were printed in Pakistan with the help of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and had been smuggled into the country through Bangladesh, the officials claimed.A study conducted by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 2016 pegged the value of fake Indian currency notes in circulation at Rs 400 crore."

Has Taapsee ever had to use such techniques in real life? She tells IndiaToday.in, ""Thankfully, since the time I have learnt it, no. I guess no one wants to take on me after that (laughs).

She can read between the lines and has a strong sixth sense. I'm very gullible, I take everything at face value,"" the actor elaborates.The toughest part of getting into Shabana's shoes was not the physical aspect of it, contrary to what people think.

This is something that has not worked for me, so why will I endorse it?""She also appeared in a video alongside Swara Bhaskar about how much cleavage is appropriate. Has Taapsee ever been slut-shamed? ""Not to my face, because I can pretty much rip a person apart if that happens. But behind my back, I'm sure people do talk, but that's how the society is. Just because a female does not walk by the conventional rules, people like to call her by different names like sl*t or b*tch or wh*re or whatever,"" the Baby actor says, advising women to make use of the block option if this happens online.""It's not worth your time and effort attending to such people. They are doing this only to get your attention. And by giving them the attention, you are fulfilling their agenda,"" she signs off."

"Shiv Sena leader Sunil Shitap was booked for culpable homicide over the collapse of a four-storey building in which 12 people were killed in Mumbai's Ghatkopar on Tuesday. Shitap, who owned the building's ground floor, reportedly carried out illegal renovations that weakened the building. Interestingly, the building wasn't on the Mumbai civic body's list of 791 unsafe buildings this year.","Summarise: A dozen people, including two infants, were killed when a 35-year-old four-storey building collapsed on Tuesday in the Ghatkopar suburb of Mumbai, a tragedy that repeats almost every monsoon in India?s space-starved financial capital.The Siddhi Sai building at Damodar Park near Shreyas cinema in western Ghatkopar came apart and trapped more than 20 people around 10.45am. Many of them are still under the rubble.Among the dead were four old people, three-month-old Renuka Thak and Krishu Dongre, who was one-and-a-half years old.The ground floor housed a nursing home, which was vacant, while the rest of the building was occupied by three or four families on each floor. Lalit Thak, who lost daughter Renuka, had shifted to the building from nearby slums three months ago.Shiv Sena leader Sunil Shitap, who owns the ground floor and allegedly made structural changes that weakened the building, was charged with culpable homicide and detained by police.Mumbai mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar denied Shitap was from his party and said: ?Appropriate action must be taken against the culprit, whoever he is.?Residents said pillars and beams were damaged when the ground floor was renovated and that caused the building to collapse. Civic officials, however, refused to assign a reason and said the cause will be known after investigation.Binita Ramchandani, a resident whose mother was injured, blamed the Shiv Sena leader for the tragedy.?Despite residents objecting his altering the building?s pillars, he went ahead because of his political clout. He was trying to convert it into a guesthouse,? she alleged.Pravin Chheda, a Congress leader, said Shitap must compensate the people.Municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta ordered a probe while police are investigating if negligence is involved in the disaster.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, there were 15 flats, three each on every floor, of which nine were vacant.The fire brigade pressed 90 personnel, 14 engines, two rescue vans and nine ambulances in its rescue efforts. About 300 rescuers, including National Disaster Response Force members, were working late into the night, looking for signs of life and bodies trapped in the rubble.Sanjay Pawar, from the nearby slums, said he dashed for the site after hearing a crashing sound that he initially thought came from a falling tree. Samriddhi Mayekar, another slum-dweller who worked at the building, saw the structure shake vigorously before it came crashing down.Building collapses are common in Mumbai, especially during the monsoon that runs from late June to September.The civic authorities conduct pre-rain checks and declare buildings unsafe when they find one. The Ghatkopar apartment did not feature among the dangerous buildings on the BMC?s list of 791 structures identified unsafe this year.But Mumbai is susceptible with millions forced to live in cramped, ramshackle properties because of rising real estate prices and a lack of housing for the poor.The city has been hit by several deadly building collapses in recent years, often caused by shoddy construction, poor quality materials or ageing buildings.In 2013, 145 people were killed in three separate building collapses around Mumbai, the highest in recent years.A dilapidated building left 12 people dead when it collapsed near the city in August 2015. Nine people died the same month when another old three-storey building collapsed in monsoon rain in the Mumbai suburb of Thakurli.In a separate incident on Tuesday, a building partially collapsed in Kolkata after days of rain. Several people were trapped in the rubble, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.With agency inputs"

"Private sector lender HDFC Bank on Tuesday reported its lowest-ever quarterly profit growth of 15% at ?3,865 crore for the December quarter. The slow growth was attributed to the government's decision to demonetise high-value currency. Notably, the lender had consistently delivered 30% profit growth for more than 32 quarters without a break till about two years ago.","Summarise: Mumbai, Jan 24 (PTI) Private sector HDFC Bank today reported its lowest-ever quarterly profit growth at 15 per cent at Rs 3,865.3 crore for the December quarter, pulled down by a margin compression following the note-ban and foreign currency deposit redemptions. The city-headquartered lender, which had made a name for itself by consistently delivering 30 per cent profit growth for more than 32 quarters without a break till about two years ago, and then slipped to the 20 per cent levels with sluggish economic growth, saw its margins narrowing by 10 bps to 4.10 per cent during the third quarter ended December 31. The Aditya Puri-headed bank also saw redemptions of USD 3 billion worth of NRI deposits raised under a special window opened by the RBI in 2013 which led to a USD 2-billion reduction in the foreign currency loan book. HDFC Bank had raised the largest amount through this window. The lender saw a 37 per cent surge in the current and saving account balances which helped the share of the low-cost deposits ratio to 45 per cent after the November 8 demonetisation. It can be noted banks were not able to benefit from the surge fully because of 100 per cent CRR on new deposits till December 8. Deputy Managing Director Paresh Sukthankar acknowledged this is the slowest profit growth ever for over two decade-old bank but defended it, saying this is because of the external environment, and declined to give any guidance on how it sees the next few quarters. He, however, said the private lender will continue to outgrow the system, and gave out data on both deposits and advances growth where it has achieved this. He said the bank lost out on ""fairly meaningful"" quantum of fees from point of sale terminals and ATM usage during the demonetisation exercise (Nov 9-Dec 30), but said this is for the benefit of larger good in the long-term. Sukthankar made a plea for a ""balance"" to be achieved on the merchant discount rates so that those investing in the infrastructure also benefit. But the market lapped the bank counter as they believe the lender did well in a challenging time. "

However, over the years, it has become one of the most watched films on TV.In fact, its situational comedy is a lesson in comic timing and how to carry off a slapstick humour. This amazingly funny film revolves around an eligible bachelor who falls in love with a gangster?s sister, and how he creates confusion to have his way. Since then, Bazmee has directed Singh Is Kinng, No Problem, Thank You, Ready and Welcome Back. All these films had the theme of marriage at the centre.Watch: Our Facebook Live discussion on Mubarakan, Indu Sarkar and Raag DeshBazmee?s latest Mubarakan follows a similar trajectory, with a double-role angle. Separated in childhood, twins, Karan and Charan (both played by Arjun Kapoor) are expected to marry as per their guardians? wishes, but they are already in love with Sweety (Ileana D?Cruz) and Nafisa (Neha Sharma).Things get complicated when Charan gets engaged to a another girl, Binkal (Athiya Shetty) in London. The shy guy couldn?t gather the courage to tell his parents about his love life and that leads to a big-intra family feud that ends when Charan?s uncle swears to marry him off in exactly one month.However, Kartar Singh (Anil Kapoor) is yet to arrive and add more confusion to the already-messed up affair.Mubarakan is a typical Bazmee film which starts with loud background music and solid bass. The hero walks in slow motion and dances to peppy tunes, but shows a docile attitude in front of the heroine. Arjun Kapoor takes a cue from Akshay Kumar in Welcome and jumps into this mad-caper wholeheartedly. It?s just that Anil Kapoor is a pro at it and steals all the limelight from him.His character drives a vehicle that has slogans like ?Buri nazar wale tera muh gora? and ?You are chasing a Punjabi? written all over it. He then employs an English man who mouths dialogues like ?Baadshaho tussi lassi pio? and ?Meri pagar padhao.? Most of us don?t expect any sort of explanations from such a film, so it keeps moving from Chandigarh to London in a jiffy with songs thrown in occasionally. They?re anyway needed to hold attention in this 156-minute film.You also find dialogues like, ?Ye zaroor druggie hai? Ye Punjab se aaya hai.? Then somebody casually mentions, ?Udta Punjab,? and everybody starts laughing.Anil Kapoor, however, tries his best to hold the family and the story together. As someone who unknowingly keeps creating chaos, he has been rightly given a good screen time. The only actor who outperforms in a couple of scenes is Pavan Malhotra. As an always angry hotelier who hates to be seen down upon, he is hilarious.Mubarakan shows some witty character sketches before losing its charm in the later half. The indecisive Arjun Kapoor and self-musing Anil Kapoor successfully establish a mood where you don?t mind dialogues like, ?Iss baar Christmas 25 ko hai?? or, ?Ye mooli, maamooli nahi hai.? In fact, you laugh when somebody falls off a window while trying to find the mobile network. Well, I did.Unfortunately, such moments keep getting fewer in number in the second half as the film gets totally centred on Anil Kapoor and his antics. Unlike Welcome, he doesn?t get much support from his co-actors and gigs become repetitive in nature.Some of Priyadarshan?s most likeable comedies also deal with an army of actors and a confusing thread in the climax, but he doesn?t waste much time in clearing the confusion. Bazmee takes time here as some of his characters go for long monologues. This slows down the pace and gives the audience a chance to realise the loopholes in the otherwise over-simplified story.Mubarakan is designed as a family film where comedy is generated through quarrelling relatives. This works initially but goes out of control later.But that doesn?t mean you won?t be entertained. You?ll be occasionally laughing, but probably won?t be leaving the theatre with a big smile on your face.Interact with Rohit Vats at Twitter/@nawabjha"

In June, 55 students were stranded along between two streams of the Kundalika river. They were rescued after a six-hour rescue operation.

"A photograph of primary school students in Madhya Pradesh's Neemuch district shows that the children are being forced to study in a disused toilet as there is no school building. While the school is run by a single teacher, the local MLA is reportedly not aware of the existence of any such school in his constituency.","Summarise: If a picture is worth a thousand words, this one tells much more than that.A photograph of a group of primary school students studying in a toilet instead of a classroom in Neemuch district belies the tall claims of the Madhya Pradesh government about its efforts to improve education in the state. The students are being forced to study in a disused toilet because there is no school building. The primary school run by a single teacher is not situated in a remote area but at Mokhampura village which is only 35 km away from the Neemuch district headquarters. Shockingly, the local MLA is not even aware that such a school exists in his constituency, though the officials of the state education department acknowledge the appalling situation. The school was set up in 2012. For a year, the school had functioned out of a rented room. Now, that?s not available.A photograph of the school which has 34 children clearly shows that the room in which they are studying is a toilet that was built by the government. If that?s not bad enough, a few goats are sometimes tied in the toilet ? perhaps to prevent them from getting wet in the rain. School teacher Kailash Chandra says that he has been forced to take classes in the toilet because there is no school building. ?When the weather is fine in summer and winter, the classes are held under a tree, but now the earth is wet so I cannot hold the classes under a tree and am forced to use the toilet,? he told HT.Kailash Chandra said that it is not as if the higher-ups have not been informed. ?I have informed them of the condition a number of times over the years, but no one is paying any attention,? he said. But Manasa BJP MLA Kailash Chawla simply refused to acknowledge that there was any school in his constituency where children were studying in a toilet. However, the district education office K C Sharma said that he had written to the state education department about the situation and had sent proposal for construction of a school building."
"DMK's Working President, MK Stalin has said former Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam never raised doubts about the mystery behind the death of ex-AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa when he was CM. ""Only after he was denied the chief minister's chair, which was two months after her death, did Panneerselvam choose to go on meditation under media spotlight,"" he added.","Summarise: In a scathing attack, DMK's working president MK Stalin alleged that former Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam was using former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's name for gaining political mileage. Taking on Panneerselvam for criticising his demand that Jayalalithaa's name be removed from government schemes, Stalin said OPS had never raised doubts about the mystery behind the death of Jayalalithaa when he was chief minister. Stalin's remark demanding removal of Jayalalithaa's photo from government installations and her name from government funded public welfare schemes has stirred a new controversy in the state. Both VK Sasikala and O Panneerselvam camps have taken extreme offense to Stalin's statement.Stalin, still holding his stand claimed that it is illegal and unconstitutional to depict pictures of Jayalalithaa on government funded programs."
"Rishi Kapoor slammed director Anurag Basu for delaying 'Jagga Jasoos', and said the film was in post-production even two days before release. ""You may be...biggest director in the world but nobody would like to work with you...you're irresponsible,"" added Rishi. He further said that in the entire process, he and Ranbir, who's the film's co-producer, are getting a bad name. nn","Summarise: Rishi Kapoor lashed out at director Anurag Basu after the lukewarm response to son Ranbir Kapoor?s new film, Jagga Jasoos. Calling him irresponsible, the actor said that Basu fails to complete films on time. In an interview with Mid-Day, Rishi Kapoor also slammed music composer Pritam.  ?Till Wednesday, Anurag Basu was still mixing the film. Can you imagine that? Pritam (composer) probably delivered the music only a week before. What can you say? You don?t take an opinion from anybody. Today?s filmmakers are doing this with everybody. They don?t show their films before release to take opinions, and treat it as though they?re making a nuclear bomb. I didn?t hate or love the film. I only felt it needed to be abridged by 20 minutes. But who is going to give that opinion to them? I totally agree with Ekta (Kapoor) when she threw him out from her film. He had problems with Rakesh Roshan while working on Kites (2010). He?s such an irresponsible director that he doesn?t complete the film. It was supposed to release three times in the past two years, but it kept getting delayed. Asked about why the film wasn?t released in some international markets on time, Rishi Kapoor again blamed Basu?s delays. ?It did not release in Singapore because you have to deliver it five days in advance. It did not release in the Gulf on Thursday because it was only delivered to them on Thursday. This is unreasonable and irresponsible. You may be thinking you are making the Taj Mahal, but you are supposed to make it ready on time. Even Pritam delays his submissions. [It was later promoted as] a kids? film. But, a kids? film also has to release at the right time, like during the school vacations. At that time too, Anurag Basu wasn?t ready. There?s economics and maths involved. Everything is not just about creativity.??You may be the biggest director in the world,? he said, ?but nobody would like to work with you because you are irresponsible. There is somebody else?s money involved in this. I trusted you, and this is what you give us? Ranbir hasn?t held back on spending money on it. You even threw Govinda out of the film. If you don?t want Govinda to work in your film, why did you ask him in the first place??Jagga Jasoos released on 14 July. It has so far made Rs 45 crore. According to a Forbes report, the film recorded one of the worst Friday-to-Friday drops of all time, plummeting 85% on its second Friday. The troubled film?s relatively large Rs 110 crore budget also poses a problem in the studio?s plans for a sequel.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

Rohatgi told PTI that he had written to the government last month conveying his wish to discontinue as Attorney General and return to private practice. He said the extension given to him by the government earlier this month was ""adhoc"", till further orders, as it was done when the Prime Minister was on a visit to Russia. ""So, the government has to take a call on my decision,"" he said. Rohatgi said that he maintained a ""good relationship"" with the government and would come to its aid as and when required. He said he was appointed by the Narendra Modi government after it came to power in May 2014 and he has served his term to his full satisfaction. He said he considers this duration as the top law officer enough and does not want to be considered for reappointment. ""I have conveyed to the government last month that I dont wish to seek re-appointment. I consider the three-year term as enough and I had also served the previous BJP government for five years.

During his three-year stint, he argued many contentious matters like the challenge to NJAC Act on appointment of judges for the higher judiciary. He also defended the government which was in tussle with the Supreme Court Collegium of judges on the appointment of judges for higher judiciary.

He has also advanced the governments stand of defending the policy of Aadhaar in which the issue of Right to Privacy has been raised and is pending before apex court. As a top law officer, Rohatgi defended the governments policy of demonetisation in which the high denomination currency of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 were declared as not a legal tender. "
"After reports of approximately a dozen such cases in Haryana, two women in Delhi have complained about their braids being chopped off by unknown persons. Both the cases, wherein women did not see who chopped off their braids, occurred in Kanganheri village. Following this, villagers decided to inform the police and take turns to keep round-the-clock guard. ","Summarise: The braids of three women in an outer Delhi village were chopped mysteriously by unknown persons on Sunday, leaving villagers scared and seeking superstitious remedies.The three incidents, which occurred over a period of about 12 hours on Sunday, took place in the houses where the women lived. Each of the women said the chopping of their braids happened soon after they experienced sudden unbearable headaches and fell unconscious. The braids were left behind at the spot.Though the police could neither comment confidently on the motive behind the mischief, nor trace the people behind it, they claimed that CCTV cameras had captured three men suspiciously roaming around in the village.Speaking to the media, Surender Kumar, DCP (south-west), vehemently opposed villagers? suspicion that these activities had supernatural connections. ?Witchcraft is totally ruled out. We are probing this in a scientific manner,? he said adding that theft could also be a possible motive. Villagers, however, denied any thefts in the area.According to media reports, around a dozen similar activities were reported in places such as Gurgaon, Palwal and Mewat in Haryana. However, Sunday was the first time this was reported in Delhi.The first victim was a 55-year-old woman living in Kanganheri village in outer Delhi?s Chhawla. A woman with red hair, she was returning home from her farm around 10.30 am on Sunday when she suddenly experienced a severe headache.The moment she entered her home, she locked the outermost six-feet high iron gate and jumped into a bed in the drawing room, leaving the drawing room door ajar. Her sleeping position was such that her face and gaze were away from the door.?Suddenly, I felt extreme pain in my head. I held my head and screamed for my grandchildren. But my screams were drowned in the sound of the cooler,? she told HT.When her granddaughter visited the drawing room a few minutes later, she found the woman unconscious on the floor. ?Her chopped braid was lying on the ground. We immediately informed the villagers and the police,? her son told HT. He had run out of the house to see if there was anyone, but he could not find any stranger.?No one approached me on my way back home from the farm. No one followed me into my house and no one touched me when I lay on the bed. I don?t remember anyone chopping off my hair either,? she said. Unaware of similar happenings in Haryana, the local police initially suspected the role of one of her relatives. But even as the villagers were discussing this unusual activity, a similar case happened in another house in the village with a population of over 5,000.This time it was a 45-year-old woman who had been dropped off at her home by her son around 8 pm. She had just got off the bike when she reported headache. Her son took her to bed and left. Within minutes, she experienced a similar pain and fell unconscious. When she woke up, she found her reddish braid chopped off. She too had not seen the culprit. By 11.30 pm, a 50-year-old woman living at the other end of the village lost her whitish braid. She had to be taken to a hospital before she regained consciousness. The same pattern in all three cases has prompted police to suspect that the culprits intoxicated the women.?There were also thefts at one or two of these women?s homes,? the DCP said. The villagers, however, rejected the police?s claims of intoxication or thefts. A case of poisoning, outraging the modesty of a woman, theft and under arms act has been registered at Chhawla police station."

Kovind secured 2,930 votes as against 1,844 by Opposition's candidate.","Summarise: More than 100 legislators across the country cross-voted in favour of the BJP-led NDA nominee, Ram Nath Kovind, in the July 17 presidential election.Cross-voting by MLAs was reported in West Bengal, where the Trinamool Congress is in power, and in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Goa.At the end of the vote count on Thursday, Kovind secured 2,930 votes with the total value of 702,044 as against 1,844 by opposition candidate Meira Kumar in the absence of a whip by any political party.Kovind?s overall vote value was 661 more than the assured value of 701,382, comprising lawmakers from the NDA and some opposition parties. In contrast, Kumar?s total vote value stood at 367,314.?The Congress candidate had asked MPs and MLAs to vote on the basis of antaraatma ki awaz (inner conscience). There are 116 people who had not openly pledged their support to Kovind but voted for him.

As many as 11 Congress MLAs voted for the NDA candidate.It exposed chinks in the opposition party facing rebellion by senior leader Shankarsinh Vaghela.Besides, three Rajya Sabha seats in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be vacant in August and the Congress expects to win one, provided it can keep its flock together. The BJP is comfortably placed on the other two seats.?We will thoroughly look into the matter once the final results come from states and take appropriate action. However, Kumar got more votes than expected in many states such as Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Nagaland. The important aspect is that the opposition parties stood united and will remain so in future as well,? Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.Rajasthan brought some cheer for the Congress as Kumar secured half-a-dozen more votes than expected. While the Congress has 24 MLAs and got the support of two BSP legislators and two independents, Kumar secured 34 votes.It was, however, not clear whether any of the surplus votes came from the BJP, which has 161 MLAs. Kovind got the support of 166 and it?s likely that the additional votes for Kumar might have come from smaller parties.In Uttar Pradesh, Kumar was expected to get the vote of 74 legislators from the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal. However, she got 65, indicating cracks in the opposition camp, especially the SP.About a dozen legislators from the opposition camp in Maharashtra voted for Kovind. The BJP, the Shiv Sena and some smaller parties that assured their support to the NDA candidate constituted 195 MLAs, but Kovind ended up with 208 votes.The opposition camp comprising 42 MLAs of the Congress and 41 of the Nationalist Congress Party had the support of nine MLAs from the AIMIM, SP and other parties. But Kumar got only 77 votes.The BJP that has made strong forays in West Bengal secured the support of at least five MLAs from the opposition camp. The BJP and its ally, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, have three MLAs each. Kovind secured 11 votes.In Tamil Nadu, both factions of the AIADMK voted for the NDA?s presidential candidate. It was one of the few states such as Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka and Uttarakhand that didn?t witness any cross-voting.In Madhya Pradesh, Kumar got the support of 57 MLAs. The Congress has 56 MLAs in the state and Kumar had the assured support of four BSP MLAs and three Independents.Of the 776 members in Parliament, eight did not vote.

""India, Russia, China, and Australia have all been victims"" of terrorism, Trump said, adding that the countries, as well as the US and Europe, have ""suffered repeated barbaric attacks"" and have ""endured unspeakable horror"". In a carefully worded speech delivered at a gathering of about 50 leaders of Muslim-majority countries, Trump did not use his signature phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"", a term he often used during his campaign for the US president. Trump, however, called upon the Middle East and Muslim countries to do their bit to defeat terrorism (Full text of Donald Trump's speech). ""Terrorism has spread all across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land"", Trump said. ""Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion.""Urging countries to deny terrorists space to operate, Trump said, ""The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil...Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil.""Terming the Middle East as a holy land, Trump urged countries in the region to ""drive out"" terrorists. ""A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and drive out the extremists. Drive them out! Drive them out of your places of worship, drive them out of your communities, drive them out of your holy land and drive them out of this earth,"" the president said. ATTACKS IRAN Trump went on to criticise Iran, which just saw President Hassan Rouhani win a re-election bid, saying the country has ""for decades...fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror."" ""It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this very room"", Trump added.Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back on Twitter, posting a seemingly sarcastic tweet that read "" Iran-fresh from real elections-attacked by @POTUS in that bastion of democracy & moderation"" Saudi Arabia. Zarif indicated that Trump had during his Saudi Arabia visit milked his hosts of hundreds of billions of dollars in business deals. Trump signed deals worth nearly $400 billion. In his speech, Trump said the agreements will ""create many hundreds of thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia."" The agreements include a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase. Trump said the US will ensure that its ""Saudi friends"" get a good deal from ""our great American defense companies, the greatest anywhere in the world."" ""This agreement will help the Saudi military to take a far greater role in security and operations having to do with security"", Trump added.Â (With agency inputs)"

"At least six people were killed in a fire that struck an electronic goods factory in Noida's Sector 11 on Wednesday afternoon. The factory's employees claimed that fire tenders reached the spot about 90 minutes after the complaint was registered. Goods estimated to be worth around ?15 crore were destroyed in the fire, which was caused by a short circuit.","Summarise: Six employees of a factory that manufactured electronic goods were burnt to death after a fire engulfed a five-storey building in Noida?s Sector 11 on Wednesday.The incident was reported around 2.30pm at the factory that is located in F Block of Sector 11 near the Delhi-Noida border, police said. Some of the bodies recovered were charred beyond recognition.One of the employees, police said, sustained severe spinal injuries after he jumped down from the fifth floor.Employees, who survived the blaze, said that fire tenders reached the spot at least 90 minutes after the first call was made to the police. Fire department officials, however, rubbished the claims and said they rushed to the spot as soon as they were informed.The fire station is located just two kilometers away from the site of the incident in Sector 2. ?Twelve fire tenders, one 32 meters and another 42 meters hydraulic lift machines reached the spot within 30 minutes of being informed. It took us time to reach the spot because of traffic and encroachment on the road. Our Ghaziabad staff also reached the spot and lent us a helping hand,? said Aman Sharma, a fire department official. Initial estimates suggest that good sworth at least Rs 15 crore was gutted in the fire.Sources also said that the blaze also brought to the fore major lapses with regards to jurisdiction. Employees trapped inside the building said they kept calling 100 to inform Noida police about the incident but their call was diverted to neighbouring Delhi and Ghaziabad. A factory employee, Sheeshpal, said, that the fire broke out around 1pm. ?When we dialed 100, the call connected to Delhi police control room. Later, when we again tried to contact the police, the call connected to Ghaziabad police control room. After several attempts, we finally connected to Noida police control room,? he said. Sheeshpal said 12 employees worked in factory. ?It appears that fire started due to a short circuit on the third floor. We were trapped on the third floor after the blaze started. While four employees rushed upstairs after the blaze, the others rushed downstairs. One employee, Vivek, jumped from the fifth floor to escape the blaze,? said Ashish Kumar, another employee. The condition of Vivek is stated to be critical.?We swung into action as soon as we were informed about the fire. Over a dozen fire tenders were sent to the spot to douse the flames. Prima facie it appears that a short circuit may have triggered the fire,? said Aman Sharma, fire officer.Police said that the death toll may rise as there might be other bodies in the basement of the building."

On the whole, the project requires 5,000 hectares.YEIDA does not have the funds to begin land acquisition, and hence, requires financial help from the Uttar Pradesh (UP)?government, which wants the Centre to fund this project that needs an investment of a whopping Rs20,000 crore, according to officials of the YEIDA.?UP civil aviation department has suggested three options to funding land acquisition for the project. The first option is that the Centre gives Rs2,000 crore for land acquisition. The second is that UP and the Centre share 50% each of the Rs2,000 crore amount.

However, we do not want to fund Rs100 crore either. Now, the UP government will discuss these issues with the Central government and expedite the project,? said Singh.Officials at YEIDA said that issues between the state and Central governments regarding the funding pattern should be finalised at the earliest to fast-track the project.

This study is crucial to take it to next stage. However, the consultant will be roped in only after funding pattern is finalised,? Singh said."
"Virender Sehwag has revealed Virat Kohli used to be ""shy and quiet"" in front of senior players but used to be ""very very naughty"" when in the U-19 team. Sehwag added that once Kohli fell ill and after being told by his U-19 coach that he wouldn't play the next match, his ""fever went away"" and he ""started batting normally"". ","Summarise: Former India opener Virender Sehwag is someone who knows Virat Kohli very well, having played with him for the national team. He also had heard of the flamboyant batsman in the domestic circuit in Delhi and knew immediately that a special talent was in the making. Sehwag knows the India captain in and out and now has some interesting tales to tell about Kohli.Until Kohli became the captain of the Indian Test team, he was infamous for his brash and aggressive attitude and had quite a few run-ins with opposition players on the field. Coming from Delhi, the aggression and extreme passion for the game came naturally to him which reflected in his game as well.Sehwag though, was quite the opposite even though he hails from the same state. The Nawab of Najafgarh was always seen as a jovial character who used to sing songs while batting and made light work of the high-class bowling that he faced during his illustrious career. Even now in his career as a broadcaster, Sehwag is hilarious with his commentary and doesn't like to mince his words.Sehwag, in a recent show with Star Sports, narrated a particular story about Kohli where he revealed how he used to behave like a shy youngster in front of the seniors but was the complete opposite during his U-19 days.""He was a shy and quite youngster in front of us senior players but when he was in the U-19 team he used to be very very naughty. I've heard a lot of stories about how naughty he was him from his U-19 coach Ajit Chaudhary.""Once Chaudhary told me that Kohli fell ill or was play acting so his coach told him that he wouldn't play in the next match. And suddenly Kohli's fever went away and he became absolutely fine after hearing that, started batting normally the way he does in the nets also. He played the next match and smashed a double hundred,"" Sehwag told Star Sports in an interview.Sehwag also recalled the time he heard about Kohli for the first time and what he thought of the future India captain the first time he saw him bat live."

"Five months after the death of Sarvanan Ganeshan, a 26-year-old junior resident doctor of AIIMS, which was thought to be a suicide earlier, a murder case was registered last week in the case. Someone had forcefully injected a medicine in his right forearm and Ganeshan could not have done so, as he himself was right-handed, reports said.

Sources said the panel of doctors that had conducted his postmortem said it appeared to be a a case of murder and not suicide after which a case was registered. Ganeshan was doing his MD degree at AIIMS at that time.The report said the cannula through which the medicine was injected was fixed in the right forearm and as Ganeshan was right handed, it wouldn?t have been possible for him to do it himself. ?Doctors said he could not have possibly placed the cannula on the spot on which it was found. They said it appears someone injected the medicine forcefully,? a police source said.Sources said the bottle of medicine, suspected to be potassium chloride, was not found at the spot. ?If he injected on his own, then the bottle should have been on the spot. No such bottle was recovered by the investigative team. Also, the door of the flat was ajar and no suicide note was found at his flat. All this indicates that it may be a case of murder,? a police source said.Police said Ganeshan?s father had also moved a writ petition in the high court, pleading that the case be handed over to crime branch for investigation. The police said earlier they suspected it to be a case of suicide as there were no visible abrasions on his body.?Ganeshan?s father said he suspects murder. He told us that Ganeshan had no reason to commit suicide as he was doing very well for himself and was happy to have joined AIIMS. He said Ganeshan was not on any medicine and no prescription was found from his room,?a police officer said. He added, ?His father requested that the case be given to the crime branch.

"Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has said that it's a misconception that the underworld invested money in Bollywood. He added that earlier, the activities of underworld related to Bollywood were mostly limited to making calls to scare celebrities. Notably, Varma is known for directing gangster dramas including 'Satya' (1998) and 'Company' (2002), among others.","Summarise: Mumbai, May 27 (PTI) Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma says contrary to the popular perception, underworld never invested money into Bollywood and there was never really a ""nexus"" between them. Varma says the activities of underworld with regard to Bollywood were mostly limited to making calls to either scare celebrities or help their friends. ""Its a misconception that theres a nexus between underworld and Bollywood. Underworld never put money, which again is a misconception. If underworld also has to put money, why is it underworld? It defeats the purpose,"" Varma told reporters last evening. ""Most of the times, either they use it for publicity, they used to get high in scaring who we think are our stars and big filmmakers. But the underworld at that time was in the mood of being in the news. They were very publicity crazy at that time."" The filmmaker was speaking at a special event where he unveiled the teaser of his upcoming web series ""Guns and Thighs"", which chronicles the rise and fall of the Mumbai underworld. ""By 2004, most of the gangsters were killed and they lost a lot of power. Disbanding the encounter squad was a signal that underworld as a force has been completely reduced."" The director, known for making several gangster-dramas like ""Satya"", ""Company"" and ""D"", says he has never been at the receiving end of the underworld because of his films. ""If I am still alive that means I am not at the receiving end. Why would the underworld have any problem with anyone making a film."" His web-series will have four seasons of ten episodes each in which Varma says he has ""pushed the envelope"" when it comes to the content as the digital medium offers freedom to tell stories the way one wants to. Asked whether it is hard not to glorify someone, especially when one is making a film on gangsters, Varma says, ""Gabbar Singh is the most loved character, but I dont know if a single person got inspired to become a dacoit in Chambal valley after seeing Sholay.

"More than 31 million people, that is one person every second, were displaced in their country in 2016 because of conflicts, violence and natural disasters, a Norwegian Refugee Council report has revealed. Adding that the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the worst affected country, the report said that natural disasters displaced over three times the number uprooted by conflicts. ","Summarise: Conflict, violence and natural disasters forced more than 31 million people to leave home and settle elsewhere within their countries last year, the equivalent of one person every second.But while the number of people uprooted by conflict outnumbers refugees by two to one, they have been largely ignored by the international community, according to a report by the Norwegian Refugee Council?s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Alexandra Bilak, director of the IDMC, said that while resources had rightly been devoted to the refugee crisis, scant attention had been paid to people forced to resettle. ?Not including internal displacement as an integral part of that entire displacement and migration picture is very shortsighted, because by looking only at the point of arrival and not considering where those journeys started, inevitably you?re missing part of the picture,? she said. ?If you redirect attention to the countries of origin and to really understanding the driving forces of these movements it would be a much more strategic approach and investment,? added Bilak.Last year, an estimated 6.9 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and violence. Worst affected was the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 922,000 were displaced, a 50% rise on the previous year. Close behind was Syria (824,000), followed by Iraq (659,000), Afghanistan (653,000), Nigeria (501,000) and Yemen (478,000).Disasters such as floods, storms and wildfires had an even greater effect, displacing 24.2 million people, more than three times the number uprooted by conflict. This trend was at its most acute in east Asia and the Pacific. In China, 7.4 million were forced from their homes, with 5.9 million affected in the Philippines and a further 2.4 million in India. Floods accounted for half of all people displaced by disasters. In some cases, a complex mix of conflict and disaster has forced communities from their homes, the report?s authors noted. It pointed to the situations unfolding in Nigeria, South Sudan and Somalia, where drought combined with conflict and violence are fuelling displacement, severe food insecurity and famine. Bilak said the number of displacements due to violence in DRC was proof that the underlying conflicts cannot be ignored. ?Unless the crisis and the factors that lead to this crisis are addressed they will re-erupt on a cyclical basis.?In May last year, the UN proposed (pdf) that governments commit to reducing the number of internally displaced people by at least 50% by 2030. The report warned this is little more than an aspiration, however.Last year, more aid was spent on refugee resettlement within donor nations than in the countries where displacement crises originated.?What we focus on is the symptom of this breakdown of protection and human rights of people in their local communities. We just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders,? said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council.He said there is a link with refugees ? though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.Six of the 10 countries that produced the most refugees in 2015 ? Afghanistan, Colombia, DRC, South Sudan and Syria ? were also among the 10 with the largest number of internally displaced people.Egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse. ?First, conflict resolution needs to be redoubled, tripled, quadrupled,? he said. ?It?s incredible there?s not a bigger pull towards a peaceful settlement of the Yemeni conflict. We also need to get economic life to countries like Yemen and elsewhere so there?s not a collapse in social structures there. Then we need investment in avoiding environmental degradation, and we need disaster risk reduction.?"

He also urged the government not to turn Hindustan into ?lynchistan?. ?Don?t make lynchistan out of Hindustan,? Kharge said.He said the incidents of mob lynchings were not coming down.Slamming the BJP governments in Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress leader said: ?Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh have become mob lynching centres.?Kharge was referring to increasing incidents of cow vigilantes lynching people on suspicion of carrying beef or while ferrying cattle.Kharge said that minorities, Dalits and women were being targeted under the Modi government.He also demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should come to the House and clear his government?s stand on the issue of mob lynching.Kharge was interrupted by BJP?s Nishikant Dubey, who said that the cases mentioned by him were subjudice and asked why he was discussing them.Responding to Dubey, the Congress leader asked the government how many cases were registered against cow vigilantes and how many people had been arrested. ?On one hand you disown these people, but what action is being taken against them?? he asked, adding that no action was being taken against such people. Taking a dig at the government, Kharge said, ?All these crimes are happening because you are trying to impose your ideology and philosophy on the people.?"
"Amid the ongoing border standoff with China, Defence Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday told the Lok Sabha that the Indian armed forces are fully equipped to face any contingency. This comes a week after the CAG had slammed the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for inadequate quality of ammunition supplied to the Army since March 2013.","Summarise: The Indian armed forces are fully equipped to face any contingency, defence minister Arun Jaitley told the Lok Sabha on Friday amid the ongoing border standoff with China.Asserting that any shortage in terms of arms and ammunition would be expeditiously made up, the minister said the observations by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) about ammunition supplies was for a particular period.Last week, the CAG had slammed the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for critical deficiency in availability of ammunition to the Army.?The armed forces are fully equipped to face any contingency? and any shortage of ammunition would be expeditiously made up, Jaitley said during Question Hour.The remarks come at a time when India and China have been locked in a standoff over the Doklam issue while there have also been rising terror incidents in Jammu and Kashmir.In a report, the apex auditor had also criticised the OFB for inadequate quality of ammunition supplied to the Army since March 2013.According to the report, despite serious concerns highlighted in a high-level report on ?Ammunition management in Army? in 2015, no significant improvement took place in the critical deficiency in availability of ammunition and quality of ammunition supplied by the OFB. Regarding CAG reports, Jaitley said that as per procedure, after tabling in Parliament, they go to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and if the latter makes some recommendations, then action would be taken.?If any action is to be taken, it will be taken,? Jaitley said in response to queries on whether any action would be taken against officials following observations in the CAG report.When a member wanted to know about the amount of ammunition required and other details, Jaitley said it is better in public interest not to make any such disclosure.Responding to queries, Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre assured the House that no ordnance factory would be closed down and no one would be rendered unemployed.On strategic partnerships in the defence sector, Jaitley said it is intended to institutionalise a transparent, objective and functional mechanism to encourage broader participation of the private sector in the manufacture of defence platforms and equipment.Besides, the government has approved a proposal for manufacturing of ammunition for the Indian Army by the Indian industry, he said.In this regard, Jaitley said Request for Proposal (RFP) under open tender enquiry was issued in March.?Since the proposal is presently at RFP stage, grant of permission to any private company for manufacturing ammunition in parternship with foreign vendors/companies which have been blacklisted/banned for wrong doings/corrupt practices, does not arise,? the minister said.Further, Jaitley said the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)/Defence Procurement Manual (DPM) contain provisions in standard clauses of contract for use of undue influence, including engagement of agents unauthorisedly by the seller.     ?DPP/DPM also provides for execution of a pre-contract integrity pact with the objective of ensuring that the procurement process is free from any wrongful business practice,? he added.     The minister also said violation of the pact can result in calling off the negotiations, cancellation of contracts, encashment of bank guarantees and debarment from future procurement. PTI RAM ARC "

"Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien on Thursday said airlines have no authority to impose a flying ban on anybody, including parliamentarians. The remark came in response to the issue raised by MP Naresh Agrawal about the recent bans on parliamentarians. If any MP does something against the law, the law of the land should take its course, Kurien added.","Summarise: Airlines have no authority to impose flying ban on anybody, including parliamentarians, and the law of the land should take its course, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman PJ Kurien said on Thursday.The remarks came after SP member Naresh Agrawal raised the issue of recent flying ban imposed by major domestic airlines, including state-owned Air India.Agrawal wanted to know if the airlines could impose such restrictions. According to him, such an action was a breach of privilege of the Members of Parliament.To this, Kurien said agreed that Agrawal has raised a ?valid point? that if any MP has committed a crime or something against the law, the law of the land should take its course.?Airlines are not given the authority to punish anybody. I think the government should take note of it.?MPs are also citizens ... if they commit a crime or mistake, the law of the land should take recourse to it,? the deputy chairman said.He further said ?it is a punishment imposed on an MP for some crime...This cannot be done. This is not a thing to be punished by airlines?.Congress MP Anand Sharma suggested to the deputy chairman that the word ?crime? should be replaced with ?violation?.However, Kurien said if a person beats up someone, it is a crime.Different airlines on Wednesday lifted the flying ban on TDP lawmaker JC Diwakar Reddy after ?urgent? notices from the court to the government and the aviation regulator DGCA on the lawmaker?s plea against the action of domestic carriers.On June 15, Reddy got into a verbal spat with IndiGo ground staff at Visakhapatnam airport and threw a printer kept at the airline counter after he was informed that boarding for his flight to Hyderabad had closed.Reddy was the second MP after Shiv Sena?s Ravindra Gaikwad who was banned from flying domestic airlines. A flying ban was imposed on Gaikwad in March this year after he repeatedly hit an Air India officer with slippers for not providing him a business class seat on an all-economy flight.The ban was lifted after a fortnight following an undertaking from him that he would desist from such conduct in future.

The legal proceedings are all over, and the Bandra family court today granted Malaika and Arbaaz a divorce.It was last November that Malaika and Arbaaz filed for a divorce by mutual consent. Over the last six months, the two actors have been spotted together on numerous occasions. Even yesterday, Malaika and Arbaaz were together along with their son Arhaan at Justin Bieber's concert at the DY Patil stadium in Mumbai.

"The Noida authority has decided to repaint road markings in an attempt to streamline and regulate traffic movement on city roads.

The decision comes after the Noida authority?s traffic cell found out that 80% of road markings in the city are either washed away or fade out on their own. Road markings are used as a means of controlling and guiding traffic. ?We are likely to start painting road marks from July 15. We have already completed the procedures required for taking up such a project. Once the road and lane marks are in place, they will help the traffic police in regulating the flow of traffic,? Sandip Chandra, head of the Noida authority?s traffic cell, said. The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns, stop lines for vehicles and designated spaces for pedestrians, who often face problems negotiating traffic without adequate markings on roads. The traffic police recently installed close circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at intersections in Sector 57/22 and Sector 2/19 for better traffic management. ?The traffic police is keen to have CCTVs installed at other intersections too. But we need to have proper road markings before we start penalising motorists caught violating traffic norms. Once the markings are done, we will issuing challans (fines) to violators,? Layak Singh, traffic inspector, Noida traffic police, said. There are 112 traffic signals in Noida and the traffic police has 278 personnel at its disposal to regulate the movement of vehicles.The traffic police wants to make use of CCTVs to impose penalty on motorists violating traffic norms. Most of the busy  intersections and roads remain congested during peak hours traffic in the morning and evening, inconveniencing thousands of commuters. The Noida authority and the traffic police have, of late, been struggling to ensure smooth flow of traffic in busy thoroughfares. ?Whenever the traffic police writes to us for support on traffic management, we provide them the facilities required. We hope to finish the road marking work very soon in order to enable the traffic police to penalise violators,? Chandra said. "
"Britain's 22-year-old Adam Peaty broke his own world record for the 50m breaststroke to set a new one at the World Aquatics Championships on Tuesday. Peaty swam the 50m in 26.10 seconds, eclipsing the 26.42 seconds he produced at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships. Notably, Peaty also won Britain a gold in the 100 metres breaststroke.","Summarise: Adam Peaty surprised even himself after improving his own 50 metres breaststroke world record by almost half a second in one day at the world championships in Budapest on Tuesday.The Olympic champion won 100m breaststroke gold on Monday?s second day and vowed there would be ?something special? over one length on Tuesday. But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened ? a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.?I didn?t think I was going to do that,? said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time. Peaty, though, knows what matters is the title , when he will likely also be part of the British 4x100m mixed medley relay team seeking to win successive golds after victory in 2015. He added: ?I enjoyed it tonight. Obviously it?s nothing without the gold that goes along with it.?I?m going to be focusing now, staying neutral and see what we get tomorrow.? Peaty?s advantage is a huge margin over two lengths of the pool, let alone one. But he is focused on himself, having learned from experience since 2014 and winning Commonwealth, European, world and Olympic titles.?This morning I wasn?t prepared to do a world record,? Peaty added.?It was just me easing through the stroke and touching the wall. Progressing to the semi-final. It was the same tonight. I was on such a massive high from this morning and it was so hard to ignore the fact that I did a world record and try to get myself emotionally ready. I thought I was going to go slower [in the semi-final] because I was a little bit less energetic.?Peaty has the five fastest times in history over 50m breaststroke, a non-Olympic event, and admitted a sub-26sec swim had not been on his radar, with his focus on what he calls Project 56 ? swimming beneath 57sec over 100m, since Rio. He said: ?This morning everyone was like Project 25 and I was like ?go on then?. I just dived in tonight and was like ?I feel good?. I wasn?t that far behind after the start, which was a bonus for me.?Peaty surfaces sooner than his rivals, but so he is so powerful that he surges through the water.Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa, Peaty?s predecessor as world champion in 2013, clocked 26.54 in the morning heat, but finished his semi-final in 26.74 as Brazil?s Felipe Lima beat him in 26.68. Peaty is likely to be kept in reserve in the morning heats of the mixed medley relay, with Ross Murdoch an able deputy, and, assuming they qualify, Britain will be confident of success with Peaty coming in for an event which is now on the Olympic programme.Duncan Scott and James Guy earlier missed out on adding to Britain?s medal collection, which included Ben Proud?s 50m butterfly gold on Monday.. Scott and Guy had to settle for fourth and fifth place, respectively, in the 200m freestyle as the Olympic champion Sun Yang of China won his second gold, after 400m victory on Sunday. The Britons? semi-final times would have been good enough for the podium. ?It?s very disappointing. I think I got a little bit carried away at the start of the race,? Guy said.Scott, who begins his 100m freestyle campaign on Wednesday, said: ?I?m proud of that swim. I don?t think I did anything wrong, just others stepped up and performed when they needed to.?Kathleen Dawson was eighth in the 100m backstroke won by Canada?s Kylie Masse in a world record time of 58.10.

Clive Lewis has shifted his stance on article 50 quite considerably over the last seven days. A week ago he told his local paper, the Eastern Daily Press, that he could not vote for an article 50 bill on the basis of the government?s current plans. He told the paper:It is safe to say that I am deeply concerned at the direction that Theresa May and the Conservative government is taking these negotiations, and the developments that are taking place. I am very mindful of what the majority of constituents in Norwich South voted for, which is remain. I don?t think what is currently on the table, given the irreversibility of article 50, means that signing article 50 under these conditions is in the best interests of people in Norwich or the country. However it is the job of the opposition to see what we can get between now and March 31 in terms of assurances and guarantees and I think that will be critical to many people when they come to make their decision on this vote.Within the last week the government has announced it will publish a white paper about its plans.

Lewis said:I have been clear throughout that I respect the result of the referendum and will, therefore, join my colleagues in voting for the bill on its second reading. However, Theresa May does not have a mandate to dictate the terms of Brexit without listening to the British people. The whole country should be involved in determining our shared future, which is why Labour has fought for the British people to have a say, through parliament.Labour will seek to amend the bill to prevent the government using Brexit to trash our rights, public services, jobs and living standards while cutting taxes for the wealthiest.

Williams?s return is called out, the umpire overrules, and then Hawk-Eye shows the ball hit the line. They?ll replay the point. Muguruza nets. 40-15. Muguruza produces one of her most nervous shots of the afternoon, shanking out! 40-30! On the third championship point, Muguruza stops mid-point and challenges, what judgment, because Williams?s effort was long and Muguruza is the Wimbledon champion for the first time! She adds to her 2016 French Open title and after her defeat to Serena here in 2015, she now has got the better of a Williams sister in a grand slam final!

From 30-all, Muguruza gets a point for a double break when she threads a backhand down the line. Williams approaches the net but spoons a tired volley into the tramlines. Conchita Martinez, Muguruza?s temporary coach here at Wimbledon, applauds in the players? box. Martinez is the only Spanish woman to have won Wimbledon having beaten Martina Navratilova in 1994 in what was Navratilova?s last singles final here. Navratilova?s age then? 37.

Williams has enough energy to get to 30-0, before Muguruza gets back to 30-all. Williams edges ahead again, 40-30, but she can?t shake the Spaniard off, deuce. And then it?s Muguruza?s break point. A backhand saves Williams. But then a ballooned backhand puts her in trouble again. A second break point for Muguruza. An ace from Williams. No it?s not! Muguruza challenges and it was out.

And then brings up two set points with a ridiculous get on the backhand side which initially looked like it was going long, but it loops over Williams?s head and plops in! 40-15. 40-30, after Williams fights back with a one-two punch. This time it?s Williams?s turn to display her defensive skills but after a draining duel she eventually nets!

This is shaping up to be a classic, but who will blink first? I feel Williams will want to finish this in two.?At 15-all, Williams?s shot is called out. She appeals to Hawk-Eye. It was well in. The point is replayed. But this time Williams rattles well long after some awkward footwork. 15-30, perhaps Williams hasn?t quite got those missed set points out of her mind. She recovers to 30-all but then clatters a forehand into the net. And from two set points up, she?s now break point down. Muguruza then shows her nerves with a shaky forehand. Deuce. Advantage Muguruza, after the Spaniard finds her forehand again. Some brutal hitting from both - they go at each other again and again and again, and Williams goes long!

Konta couldn?t do it at 5-4 down against Williams in the semi-finals, can the Spaniard do it here? Muguruza is blown away by a brutal strike from Williams on the first point, 0-15. Williams tries to impose her will on Muguruza on the second point too but just goes long. 15-all. 15-30. 15-40 after a tame shot from Muguruza. A disappointing way to hand Williams two set points. Muguruza sends Williams from side to side but the 37-year-old keeps getting it back, before eventually fading with a netted forehand! That rally was 19 shots, the longest of the match. Muguruza saves the other set point with a strong first serve. Deuce. And now the Spaniard?s swinging. She takes the next two points to hold. Phew.

The main issue may be how grand slam schedulers would fit in five-set women?s matches. One proposal would be to play best of five from perhaps the quarter-finals onwards. Though 37-year-old Williams may rather stick to three.This has been so close and competitive so far, it could come down to such small margins, as the first set did between Williams and Konta in the semi-finals.

At Williams?s advantage, Muguruza?s effort is called out but umpire Eva Asderaki-Moore overrules. They?ll replay the point. Williams slaps a backhand into the net. Deuce. Advantage Muguruza, her first chance to break. Williams nets the first serve, what can she do with her second? Her second serve has been so strong this tournament. Williams hits the serve deep - and Muguruza can?t get her return back into play. Deuce. Advantage Williams. A third double fault, Deuce. A big serve, Williams?s advantage. Game.

First set: Williams 3-2 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)So both players have held serve fairly comfortably so far. This game is no different. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. Muguruza is making a few too many errors on her forehand at the moment. Whenever I watch Williams play, I get rather embarrassed thinking about the first time I interviewed her when I was a rookie radio reporter. I was very nervous and was struggling to press record on my mini disc player (I?m showing my age). ?Time is ticking,? she muttered under her breath without making any eye contact. The interview didn?t get much better after that as all 5?3? of me could barely stretch the microphone - which was wobbling so much because of my nerves - to her mouth. The interview lasted all of about a minute before we?d both had enough. Not my finest hour.

First set: *Williams 2-2 Muguruza (*denotes next server)It?ll be interesting to see who the crowd side with this afternoon. They do love an underdog, and even though Muguruza is the slight favourite with the bookmakers, she does almost feel like an underdog because of Williams?s experience. Early on, the support has been fairly even. Muguruza sprints to 30-0 on her serve, but then stalls her progress with an overcooked forehand. 30-15. Muguruza flirts with danger on the next point too but survives. 40-15. Game.

First set: Williams 2-1 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)You can really hear the pop, pop, pop of the ball under the roof as these two go at each other. At 30-15, Williams wallops away a forehand winner. Oof, take that. She thinks she?s repeated the trick on the next point, hitting deep into the corner, but it?s just out. Williams considers the challenge but then decides against it. 40-30. Then game.Updated

But the Spaniard steadies herself, getting back to 15-all and then ahead at 30-15. Muguruza charges forward on the next point and puts away a straightforward volley. 40-15. Muguruza goes back behind Williams, who manages to regain her footing and hit the ball, but Muguruza takes the point. Game Muguruza.

First set: Williams 1-0 Muguruza* (*denotes next server)The rain has eased off but now the roof is closed, it will remain so for the whole match. Muguruza has her left thigh heavily strapped, as she did during her semi-final win, not that it hindered her then as she charged past Magdalena Rybarikova for the loss of only two games. Williams starts as she means to go on, with an ace. 15-0. A longer point then plays out - you feel the longer rallies are more likely to be won by the 23-year-old Muguruza today - and the 37-year-old Williams whistles wide. 15-all. 30-15, as Muguruza prods long. Muguruza mishits her return and is a bit lucky to win the point, 30-all. 40-30. A brutal backhand down the line, and Williams is on the board.Updated

Royal Box watch. The King of Spain is in the house today. No, not Ashley Giles, King Juan Carlos. Also taking her place in the posh seats is Mary Berry, who?s arrived a couple of days too late to sample Johanna Konta?s muffins. Other names here today include Kelly Holmes, Hilary Swank, Jim Courier and former Wimbledon champions Marion Bartoli, Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Virginia Wade. Of course Wade was supposed to be sitting here today, smiling and clapping as the cameras endlessly zoomed in on her watching Konta become the first British woman since her to win Wimbledon.

Prediction time. Chris Evert, Tracy Austin and Kim Clijsters give the slight edge to Williams, while Martina Navratilova appears to be siding with Muguruza. This is so hard to call. They both play such a similar game, based around their big serves and groundstrokes. This will be first-strike tennis; don?t expect too many long rallies.

Muguruza says:?It?s very impressive [Williams?s longevity]. I think not everybody can do that. It goes a lot also with the strength of your body, your style of game. For me it?s incredible. I don?t think I could be 37 and playing that level. She just loves to play and she enjoys going out there. At least it?s what it shows. She keeps playing, even though she achieve so many things. She?s still motivated to go for more, which is also very surprising.??[The 2015 Wimbledon] final helped me a lot to figure out a way to play better on grass because before I was, like, not very experienced. Never played a lot of tournaments. It was just a very surprising moment when you reach a final in a tournament where you thought it was going to be difficult. Right now I know how to play more on grass.?When I reached the final in 2015, and when I won the French Open, I could feel the difference between winning a grand slam and not winning.

At the beginning of this fortnight, much of the talk at the All England Club was about the resurgence of a former champion reaching for another Wimbledon crown. But it was Roger Federer, rather than the five-time champion two years his senior who hadn?t won a grand slam singles title since 2008.In many ways, it?s surprising that Venus Williams wasn?t regarded as one of the favourites for the women?s title from the start. The 37-year-old has been a model of consistency over the past year, suggesting she has finally found a way of managing the auto-immune disease that she was diagnosed with in 2011 and that prevented her from being a contender for several years. She arrived at Wimbledon having reached at least the last 16 in her past five majors, including at this year?s Australian Open, where she lost to her sister ? then eight weeks pregnant - in the final. So often has Venus been stalled by Serena in slams ? six of her seven final defeats have been at the hands of her younger sibling ? that Serena?s absence here removed one of her most familiar obstacles.However, Williams was burdened by the fatal car accident she was involved in last month, the details of which emerged only three days before the start of Wimbledon. Asked about the incident after her first-round win, she broke down in tears at her press conference. She struggled in the second round, coming from a set down to advance. That was the last set she dropped. Perhaps using her tennis as a refuge, she started to gain momentum. There was a certain symbolism to her victories over Naomi Osaka, Ana Konjuh and the recent French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, who were all born in 1997, the year Williams made her Wimbledon debut. Then in the semi-finals, Williams had the look of a champion as she clinically ended the run of Johanna Konta.Now the only player standing between Williams and the title is Garbine Muguruza, who knows exactly what it?s like to lose to Serena in a grand slam final. The Spaniard was runner-up here in 2015 before securing her first major title at the French Open last year. A dip in form followed but she has rediscovered her touch this fortnight, under the guidance of her temporary coach Conchita Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion. Muguruza, like Williams, hits hard, so this will be a match of few subtleties. Muguruza will know that much of the narrative surrounding this final is about Williams but she is more than capable of writing her own story this afternoon. The players will be on court at: 2pm BST. Do remember you can get in touch: via email or twitter.Updated

"Israel has removed metal detectors from the entrance of Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque following days of violent protests over the installation. The move is aimed at ending the crisis which claimed seven lives, Israeli officials said. The Palestinians reportedly see the installation of metal detectors as an Israeli attempt to assert control over the holy site.","Summarise: Israel is removing metal detectors from entrances to the compound that houses al-Aqsa mosque.The move was announced late on Monday night by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and is designed to end a crisis over the holy site. Days of violent confrontations have claimed seven lives.Despite the Israeli announcement, however, a senior Muslim cleric in Jerusalem said worshippers should stay away from the shrine pending a review of the new Israeli security arrangements there.Ikrema Sabri, the head of the Supreme Islamic Committee in the city, said such a review may be completed later on Tuesday. Sabri said: ?Our position is that for now, nobody should enter? the shrine.The removal of the detectors on Tuesday appeared to be part of a deal under which Israeli diplomats were repatriated from Jordan, including an embassy security guard who was involved in a fatal shooting of two Jordanians on Sunday night.The brief statement said the Israeli security cabinet, which met on Monday evening, had ?accepted the recommendation of all of the security bodies to incorporate security measures based on advanced technologies (?smart checks?) and other measures instead of metal detectors in order to ensure the security of visitors and worshippers in the Old City and on the Temple Mount?.The statement added that under the plan Israeli police would ?reinforce? their presence around the holy site. It did not say when the metal detectors would be removed or what would replace them. Israeli media earlier reported that high-resolution cameras capable of detecting hidden objects would be the alternative.Earlier on Monday the UN?s Middle East envoy warned of the dangers of allowing the crisis to continue. ?It is extremely important that a solution to the current crisis be found by Friday this week,? Nickolay Mladenov said after briefing the UN security council. ?The dangers on the ground will escalate if we go through another cycle of Friday prayer without a resolution.? He said events in east Jerusalem were not ?localised? but ?affect millions if not billions of people around the world?.Even before the Israeli decision to remove the devices, it was unclear whether such a move would be sufficient to end the violence. Muslim religious officials ? who allege Israel is trying to expand its control at the site ? said they would accept only a return to the arrangements for access to the compound that had been in place before an incident on 14 Julywhen two Israeli policemen were shot by three Israeli Arab gunmen who had smuggled weapons on to the site.?This movement is a movement of the street,? said Sheikh Raed Dana of the waqf, the Islamic endowments organisation that administers the mosque compound, commenting on whether he believed worshippers should end protests and return to the shrine. ?We as the waqf listen to the street. The street says yes and we say yes; if the street says no to the measures, we will say no.?There has been increasing criticism of the way the metal detectors were installed, without consultation with the waqf and reportedly over the objections of senior Israeli security officials who had warned of the risk of bloodshed.On Monday night Israeli diplomats were evacuated from the embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, after Sunday?s shooting of two Jordanians by a security guard.The diplomats, including Israel?s ambassador to Jordan, Einat Schlain, crossed the Allenby bridge border in a convoy, arriving back in Israel at around 11pm. Among those repatriated were the security guard whom Jordan had originally said it wanted to retain for questioning over the incident.A Jordanian news site linked to the kingdom?s military said investigators had determined that the altercation at the embassy compound was not politically motivated and that one of the Jordanians, a 17-year-old, had attacked the guard with a screwdriver in a dispute about a furniture delivery.Under an agreement negotiated by the head of Israel?s domestic security service, who had been sent to Amman to negotiate, Israel agreed that Jordanian police could hear the guard?s description of the incident in the presence of Israeli diplomats.Netanyahu?s office said the return of the diplomats had been made possible ?thanks to close cooperation which was held in the past day between Israel and Jordan?."

One in three adults surveyed plans to migrate to a developing country.West Africa, South Asia and North Africa are the regions with the largest migration potential.The study is based on international survey data by the Gallup World Poll.?This unique global survey provides an important insight into people?s migration intentions and the profile of those most likely to migrate,? said IOM Director General William Lacy Swing.The share of the adult population planning to migrate abroad has increased moderately at the global level but more rapidly in certain regions. Adults planning and preparing to migrate are more likely to be male, young, single, living in urban areas and more likely to have completed at least secondary education.?Improving our understanding of people?s migration intentions could be useful for a range of different policy purposes. It could help policymakers plan for migration, understand better migration pressures, as well as highlighting potential migration trends where alternative sources of migration data are scarce,? it said.Â The report, however, added that it is important to note that measuring potential migration is not the same as measuring actual migration.There are many reasons why a migration plan may never be realised including policy restrictions, lack of resources or a change of heart.Â IOM Director General Swing added that the new study illuminates one trend that has been emerging for some time, which he explained was the ?wide range of countries, both rich and poor, that are attracting migrants.?

"China on Monday responded to India's statement saying it is also different from the China of 1962. ""[T]o some extent he is right in saying India in 2017 is different from India in 1962, just like China is also different,"" said a spokesperson. China has also claimed that India is using ""excuse of Bhutan's interests to infringe upon China's territory"".","Summarise: Responding to Defence Minister Arun Jaitley's statement to India Today saying India in 2017 was different from 1962, Beijing retorted on Monday that ""to some extent he is right in saying India in 2017 is different from India in 1962, just like China is also different"".China's statement came as it stepped up its claims on India ""trespassing"" at the Sikkim border.On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed that India was ""using the excuse of Bhutan's interests to infringe upon China's territory"" and suggested India had sent its troops into Bhutan without the latter's permission.""The Bhutan side does not know previously that Indian troops entered Doklam which is not in line with what India claims,"" said spokesperson Geng Shuang, contradicting India's Friday statement that the Royal Bhutan Army had on June 16 protested the PLA's construction activities in Doklam, with the Indian Army two days later supporting Bhutan and asking China to stop altering the status quo.China's Foreign Ministry also said that Jawaharlal Nehru ""explicitly recognised"" the 1890 Sikkim-Tibet treaty that Beijing is now citing to back its territorial claims.In the very same March 22, 1959 letter, Nehru also reminded China of an 1842 treaty on Ladakh and the drawing of the McMahon line in Simla in 1914, which aren't recognised by China. Citing the 1890 convention which fixes the India-China-Bhutan trijunction at Gipmochi, far south of where India and Bhutan do, the Foreign Ministry said the ""illegal trespass of border troops goes against convention and is against basic principles of the UN Charter and international laws"".""The action taken by India is undoubtedly a betrayal of consistent position held by India,"" said Geng, adding that ""Prime Minister Nehru explicitly recognised the 1890 convention between Tibet and Sikkim"" in a March 22, 1959 letter to then Chinese PM Zhou Enlai.India maintains the 1890 agreement only provides the basis of alignment of the boundary, and that the border needs to be finalised by the Special Representatives in maps and on the ground.NEHRU'S LETTER READIn the letter Geng cited, Nehru wrote that ""The boundary of Sikkim, a protectorate of India, with the Tibet Region of China was defined in the Anglo- Chinese Convention 1890 and jointly demarcated on the ground in 1895.""However, in the same letter, Nehru also mentioned agreements on the boundaries in Ladakh and Arunachal, which China now rejects.In fact, in the very same section of the letter, Nehru mentioned the following two agreements: ""The Ladakh Region of the State of Jammu and Kashmir- A treaty of 1842 between Kashmir on the one hand and the Emperor of China and Lama Guru of Lhasa on the other, mentions the India-China boundary in the Ladakh region. In 1847 the Chinese Government admitted that this boundary was sufficiently and distinctly fixed. The area now claimed by China has always been depicted as part of India on official maps, has been surveyed by Indian officials and even a Chinese map of shows it as Indian territory.""On the McMahon Line, Nehru wrote: ""The McMahon Line-As you are aware, the so-called McMahon Line runs eastwards from the eastern borders of Bhutan and defines the boundary of China on the one hand and on the India and Burma on the other. Contrary to what has been reported to you, this line was, in fact, drawn at a Tripartite Conference held at Simla in 1913-1914 between the Plenipotentiaries of the Governments of China, Tibet and India. At the time of acceptance of the delineation of this frontier, Lonchen Shatra, the Tibetan Plenipotentiary, in letters exchanged, stated explicitly that he had received orders from Lhasa to agree to the boundary as marked on the map appended to the Convention."" China, however, does not recognise those two treaties.
