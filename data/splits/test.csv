"All restaurants, including five-star hotels, in South Delhi have been directed by a Delhi civic body to make their toilets available to general public, who are not customers, at a fee of ?5 starting April 1. ""The move will be particularly beneficial for women who face problems due to lack of toilets in marketplaces,"" the South Delhi Municipal Corporation said.","Summarise: Come April and you won?t have to go looking for public washrooms to relieve yourself after a long day of shopping in a South Delhi market. Just walk into the nearest restaurant, convey your need to the staff and you will be able to use the well-equipped toilet for a meagre Rs 5.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday issued directions to all hotels, restaurants and eateries in its jurisdiction to make their washrooms accessible to the public from April 1. The move would allow anyone with Rs 5 in hand to access washrooms in even five-star hotels of South Delhi.According to an SDMC official, the decision has been taken on the advice of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to explore the possibility of making toilets in restaurants and hotels open to public use.?We want the hotels and restaurants to adhere to the decision in full spirit rather than wait for the SDMC to enforce it,? said SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel.?The hotels and restaurants will also need to put up display boards informing the public about the facilities. The managements of these restaurants have been given the discretion to charge up to ~5 per usage to cover their costs towards maintenance and cleaning,? said the corporation official.The decision will be imposed on all the 4,618 eating outlets, including hotels, which are issued health trade licences by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. ?These outlets also comprise 600 roadside eateries. However, we assume, they don?t have the provision for washrooms so, the decision doesn?t apply to them,? the official said.The move is expected to spell relief for women who have a particularly hard time for lack of enough public toilets. The civic agency is working on the modalities of the move and finalising the amount that can be imposed as penalty on defaulters. ?Since the issuance of health trade licence is at the discretion of the municipal corporation, we will add this point in its list of terms and conditions next month,? said Goel.There are 580 public urinals and 480 toilets in South Delhi. Out of 480, only 140 can be used by women. These include toilets in Lajpat Nagar, Green Park, Safdarjung Development Area, Rajouri Garden, Bhikaji Cama Place and Nehru place."
"The Chinese government has banned singer Justin Bieber from performing in the country as he has ""engaged in a series of bad behaviours, both in his social life and during a previous performance in China"". Bieber will perform in Asia later this year, with concerts scheduled in countries like Indonesia, Japan and Singapore, as part of his Purpose World Tour.","Summarise: ?I just need one more shot, second chances,? Justin Bieber sings on his latest album. Not least, it seems, with Chinese authorities who have announced the Canadian pop idol will not be allowed to perform in the People?s Republic because of his on and offstage antics. Bieber will jet into Asia later this year as part of his Purpose World Tour with shows scheduled in Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Hong Kong. But Beliebers in mainland China look set to be disappointed. In a statement posted on its website this week, Beijing?s culture bureau explained that unspecified misdemeanours meant the artist, who has had repeated run-ins with the law - including for drunken drag racing in a yellow Lamborghini - was unsuitable for Chinese ears.?Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer,? said the bureau, which was answering a fan?s demand for a ?detailed explanation? about the former teen star?s absence from Chinese stages. ?As far as we are concerned, he has engaged in a series of bad behaviours, both in his social life and during a previous performance in China, which caused discontent among the public.?The bureau did not detail the exact behaviour that had landed Bieber in its bad books, saying only that in order to ?purify? China?s performing arts it had decided the singer?s exclusion was appropriate. The singer performed in China as part of his Believe tour, in 2013, raising eyebrows when he was pictured being carried up the Great Wall of China by his bodyguards. Bieber joins an illustrious list of foreign artists who have found themselves shut out of China?s potentially vast music industry, although most have been targeted for political, not behavioural reasons. In 2015 Los Angeles band Maroon 5 were forced to scrap shows in mainland China after the group?s keyboard player sent birthday wishes to the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. In 2009 Oasis were barred after guitarist Noel Gallagher performed at a Free Tibet concert in New York.His brother Liam now appears to have been forgiven and is scheduled to play solo shows in Beijing and Shenzhen next month. Beijing?s culture bureau made it clear it was not saying never to the Canadian artist: ?We hope Justin Bieber is able to improve his conduct as he grows up and will once again find public favour.?

"The Supreme Court slammed the Election Commission on Wednesday after the latter said it cannot take a stand on whether to ban convicted politicians from contesting polls for life. ""Is silence an option for you? You must say either yes or no. How can you be silent? If you are constrained please let us know,"" the bench said.","Summarise: In a u-turn the Election Commission said on Wednesday that it cannot take a stand on a demand to bar convicted politicians for life from contesting polls, prompting the Supreme Court to criticise the poll panel for shying away from a crucial issue.?Is silence an option for you? You must say either yes or no. How can you be silent? If you are constrained please let us know,? a bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi asked the EC counsel whose submission was a departure from the stand the commission took in its affidavit.In response to a public interest litigation raising the demand, the EC had on April filed an affidavit where it supported the petitioner?s plea. The short affidavit said the commission supported the cause of the petitioner to decriminalise politics. When the court asked the commission?s lawyer, the latter replied: ?The commission is not taking an adversarial stand. We feel the issue (debarring convicted politicians) is in the legislative domain and we have no stand.??If you feel constrained by the legislature then let us know,? the bench shot back at the counsel. The Centre has already made its stand clear on the issue by opposing the petition. In its affidavit in April it had said that the court should not pass orders on the issue as this is a matter best decided by the Parliament.The court also took a swipe at the petitioner for invoking Article 14 (right to equality) in the case. The petitioner had contended that while a convicted bureaucrat and judicial officer lose his or their jobs, the same principle should apply to convicted politicians.?Are you espousing the cause of public servants, complaining of discrimination on the ground of Article 14,? the bench told the petitioner, fixing July 19 to hear the matter again.Under the Representation of the People Act, a politician convicted and sentenced to a jail term of two years or more shall be disqualified from contesting polls for six years from the date of his release from prison after conclusion of the term.The poll panel had said in its affidavit it was ?alive to the issues that concern the conduct of free and fair elections and functioning of healthy democracy and as such asserting for bringing in electoral reforms which further the cause of free and fair elections.?"

"Congress MP and former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor has categorically denied the rumours of him joining BJP. ""For 40+ years I have spoken and written in defence of a pluralist India with equal rights...On this, no compromise,"" he said. This comes after CPI(M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said four Congress leaders, including Tharoor, were planning to join BJP.","Summarise: Congress MP and former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor denied reports that he was joining the BJP.In a Facebook post, he said: ""In view of the number of people asking, let me repeat that my convictions are a matter of record and they do not match those of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)"".""For 40+years I have spoken and written in defence of a pluralist India with equal rights for all its citizens and communities,"" Tharoor, also a former UN diplomat, said.""On this, no compromise. Rumours of my joining BJP have been floated periodically with no basis whatsoever. I deny them categorically and without qualification,"" he said.The Congress MP's clarification comes in the backdrop of a statement by CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan that four Congress leaders, including Tharoor, planned to join the BJP.Balakrishnan had said there are reports that four Congress leaders from Kerala are joining the BJP and that KPCC president M M Hassan had said that one of them was Tharoor.However, Hassan denied having made any such remarks when contacted.""When media persons asked me whether the reports about four Congress leaders joining the BJP has come to his notice, I said there is no such thing,"" Hassan told PTI.""There are no fortune seekers in Kerala like S M Krishna and Jaffer Sharif,"" the KPCC president said.Tharoor campaigned for the Congress-led UDF candidate for the April 12 bypoll in Malappuram, Hassan said."
"As many as 77 votes were declared invalid in the Presidential elections, because of invalid symbols like commas, dots, and circles, according to the people involved in counting. The number '1' with a '.' was the most common mistake, while the ""1"" (one in inverted commas) came second. One voter wrote '1' on Meira Kumar's name instead of the box.","Summarise: Dots and inverted commas have come to confound political parties, who are seeking to identify rebels during the 2017 presidential poll. These led to the rejection of votes by 21 MPs and 56 MLAs, triggering much curiosity and concern among parties.These 77 votes, with a value of 20,942, might be inconsequential to the outcome: NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind romped home with a margin of 3.67 lakh (in terms of value of votes). But there is no full stop in politics, as then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said after the UPA?s victory in 2009.Both the NDA and the opposition camps are anxious to know how many of the 77 invalid votes were a result of inadvertent errors and how many were by design. Over a hundred legislators were estimated to have cross-voted in valid votes.Those involved in the counting of votes on July 20 told HT that invalid ones were due to dots, inverted commas, circles and slants that electors erroneously used on their ballot papers. They were supposed to express their first preference simply with a numeral 1 ? second preference was unnecessary in a bipolar contest?in the box against the name of Kovind or Meira Kumar, the opposition parties? nominee.A Congress MLA from Haryana wrote 1. (numeral with a period-mark) rendering his vote invalid. Most of the 77 legislators made the same mistake, said those involved in counting.The second most common error was ?1?. Some put a circle around the numeric. The BJP got one vote invalidated because the 1 was slanted ?by about 30 to 40 degrees? and not perpendicular; the Congress got the same opportunity later. One of the MLAs wrote 1 over Meira Kumar?s name.Given that legislators were clearly informed about the dos and don?ts, such errors were unexpected. Many of them could be inadvertent and a result of sheer habit but the rules set by the poll watchdog were not to be bent.Senior BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab recalled one such instance in 2012 presidential poll in which he was the counting agent for PA Sangma. A Congress MLA from Odisha decided to go by his conscience?permitted in presidential polls where there is no party whip ? and voted for Sangma. He used Oriya numeral P and not E for 1. Although both are used for 1, his vote was rejected after the Congress objected to it.The list of possible errors is long. According to Anoop Mishra, secretary general of the Lok Sabha and the Returning Officer for the presidential poll, any of these can lead a vote invalid: Writing the same preference number outside both candidate?s names, putting a tick mark, or writing outside the box. ?Votes can also be declared invalid if there are any other marks, which are not required and which can later identify the voter. These can even be a dot, a line or even a wrong-coloured ink,? he told HT.Deepender Singh Hooda, counting agent for Meira Kumar, maintained that ?broadly, votes for both sides got cancelled? due to errors, but the BJP seemed better prepared. Senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, counting agent for Kovind, said that a day before the poling, his party had made a presentation to its legislators on voting rules.?It?s possible that some members themselves might have got their votes rejected, but there could also be inadvertent errors. The Election Commission should think of a better way to ensure that votes are not rejected,? said Hooda."
"A woman, who fell from the tallest bridge in USA's California while taking a selfie and landed 60 feet below on a trail, is expected to survive, the Placer County Sheriff's office said. The woman suffered several fractured bones and requires surgery. She fell from the 730-feet-tall Foresthill Bridge, the highest in California and among the highest in the US.","Summarise: A woman fell 60 feet from one of the US tallest bridges while taking a selfie but miraculously survived after landing on a trail below. The Sacramento-area woman was expected to survive after she fell 60 feet off the restricted area of the Foresthill Bridge near Auburn, California, while trying to take a selfie, the Placer County Sheriffs Office said. Paul Goncharuk, a friend of the woman, told CNN affiliate KOVR that ""she was knocked unconscious, suffered a deep gash to her arm and fractured bones that will require surgery."" Goncharuk also confirmed that ""they were taking a picture on the bridge, and then the big bolts that are holding the beams together, she stepped on them kind of weirdly and lost balance and fell backwards."" Police in a California county put out a Facebook post after she fell, warning camera-toting thrill seekers that, ""You can lose your life and none of that is worth a selfie!"" The 730-foot-tall bridge is the highest in California and one of the highest in the United States. The woman, whose identity has not been revealed, and a group of her friends were walking on the catwalk underneath the bridge when she tried to take a selfie and fell 60 feet onto a trail below, the sheriffs office said. She was airlifted to Sutter Roseville Medical Center for treatment. The walkways under the bridge were closed to the public, and it was illegal to walk on them, according to the sheriffs office. Anyone seen on the catwalks could be cited or arrested if they were found in any closed area. ""This young lady is very lucky to be alive and the consequences could have been worse for her, her friends and her family,"" the Placer County Sheriffs Office wrote on its Facebook page. The bridges off-limits underbelly seems to be a popular, but dangerous spot for social media posting. Police have started patrolling the area after a series of pictures and videos of people dangling from walkways under the bridge. "
"Pakistan has put a ban on Tehreek-e-Azadi-Jammu & Kashmir (TAJK), the new terror outfit of the 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed. Saeed's previous terror fronts Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and JuD were declared terrorist organisations by the US, after which he started running his activities under the TAJK banner. Pakistan had earlier put him on house arrest.","Summarise: After placing Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD)'s Hafiz Saeed under house arrest on January 30, Pakistan has now banned his new terror front Tehreek-e-Azadi-Jammu & Kashmir (TAJK).JuD was declared a terrorist outfit by the US in 2014 and and was again put under the watch list on January 27.Â The Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA ) put TAJK on the list of proscribed organisations on June 8, forcing Saeed to run his activities under the TAJK banner.Â Hafiz Saeed had adopted the name JuD after its terror outfit, Laskar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) that basically perpetrates terror in India, was banned by Pakistan on 14 January 2002 under international pressure. However, it did not affect him.Â In December 2008, the UN Security Council, under its Resolution 1267, imposed sanctions on JuD and Hafiz Saeed for supporting Al Qaeda and Taliban. India had named Hafiz Saeed, LeT and JuD as the perpetrators of the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. Since then there has been an unending drama of Hafiz Saeed being put under house arrest or detained cursorily before being set free even if the US declared a bounty of USD 10 million on his head in 2012.Â Things took a turn after Donald Trump was elected president in the United States. The US clearly told Pakistan to act against JuD after its name prominently figured in the report of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. If Pakistan failed to comply to this it would be put on the list of blacklisted countries in the International Cooperative Review Group (ICRG). That would make it necessary for Pakistan to put a formal request each time it went about transacting any business through any of the international financial institutions.Â Left with no other option, Pakistan had to put Hafiz Saeed under house arrest on January 30. Even if symbolic, it made a huge difference that we can see now with TAJK ban, as Donald Trump is completing six months in office.Â Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump in a joint statement, during Indian PM's US tour, labeled Pakistan a terror haven. Not to mention the US has designated Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist. Pakistan, probably, was expecting all this to happen, and therefore would have decided to act on Hafiz Saeed's new terror front before it became another international rallying point against it."

"The intelligence agencies have reportedly revealed that boys as young as 4 and 5 years old are participating in the stone pelting in Kashmir. However, after being caught, many of these kids revealed they have no idea what they are involved in. The stone pelting protests have now spread to rural regions, said the intelligence agencies as per a report.","Summarise: Intelligence agencies say stone-throwing protests in Kashmir, which picked up after militant leader Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter with security forces last July, have now spread to rural regions.Authorities are worried as they say the crowds in the countryside are more belligerent. An officer says boys as young as 4 and 5 are participating in the stone- pelting.After being caught, many of these kids reveal that they have no idea what they are involved in. The J&K Police have appealed to parents to ensure that they are not drawn into disruptive activities by militants or overground workers funded by Pakistani agencies.Young boys took to throwing stones in mass demonstrations that rocked Kashmir Valley in 2008 and 2010. Since then, it has become a popular way for youths to express their anger against the government, and authorities have been constantly looking to stamp out any repeat.Many children were taken into custody for stone-pelting in 2010 but let out after the state government gave them amnesty.MANY MLAS SCARED TO VENTURE OUT IN THEIR OWN CONSTITUENCIES Though the magnitude of the problem has increased manifold, security forces feel that it is the lack of the PDP-BJP administration's ability to reach out to the people that has angered them more. Many of the MLAs are scared to venture out in their own constituencies due to fear of assault. Chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has visited several locations, said a source, but she has been ringed by security, rendering the trips almost futile. Another officer said, ""Since her election from Anantnag, the CM has not been seen here."" A video of a security forces-militant encounter this year in Hajin village of J&K has been doing the rounds not just in the state but also among soldiers. The pictures are stark- crowds from the area running after an army truck even as the force suffered a casualty. Major Satish Dahiya was killed in the gun battle. But it is the stone-pelting, which has worried the security forces.Many in the forces feel the problem is not limited to law and order and there has been only a weak attempt to broker peace in the region with politicians spewing mistrust."
"US-based researchers tested a cluster of trees, soil and woody debris to determine whether those three components were sources or sinks of greenhouse gases. Tree trunks were found to emit methane rather than storing it, scientists said, which could counteract absorption of methane by forest soils. However, the mechanism of methane production in forests was not clearly understood.","Summarise: Washington, Apr 3 (PTI) Tree trunks in upland forests actually emit methane rather than storing it, say scientists who claim to have found a new, previously unaccounted source of this powerful greenhouse gas. Researchers from University of Delaware (UD) in the US found that upland forest soils usually take up and store methane, but this effect can be counteracted by methane emissions from tree trunks. They tested a cluster of trees, soil and coarse woody debris (CWD) - dead wood lying on the forest floor in various stages of decomposition - to measure fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide. The team used a state-of-the-art greenhouse gas analyser based on laser absorption technology, called Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS). They visited the site over the course of one growing season - April to December. Researchers measured the carbon dioxide and methane fluxes of the soil, tree trunks and CWD to determine whether those three components were sources or sinks of these greenhouse gases. ""We believe our work can help fill in some gaps in methane budgets and environmental processes in global ecosystem models,"" said Rodrigo Vargas assistant professor in UD. ""What we have found in this study is that some coarse woody debris act kind of like the soil and consume methane while other pieces of coarse woody debris emit small amounts of methane, which is also what we saw with living tree trunks,"" said Daniel Warner of UD. ""The tree trunks constantly have low but detectable emissions of methane,"" said Vargas. ""Soils are providing an environmental service of sequestering this potent greenhouse gas, but the trunks are releasing methane equivalent to 4 per cent of what could be captured by CWD and soils at the ecosystem scale,"" he said.

"A probe has found that JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar did not raise anti-India slogans for which he was charged with sedition last year, according to India Today. Anti-India sloganeering took place in the JNU campus, but Kanhaiya's voice did not match the audio, the reports added. Most of the other slogan shouters were Kashmiri students, the probe added.","Summarise: Last week's violent fracas at Delhi's Ramjas College has ignited, yet again, a nationwide debate on freedom of speech and what it means to be (anti) national. The script of the current unrest seems similar to last year's Jawaharlal Nehru University controversy when a group of students was alleged to have raised anti-national slogans. However, JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar raised no anti-India slogans for which he was charged with sedition last year, top officials investigating the case have revealed to India Today, citing forensic examination of voice samples. Â Controversial slogans resonated through the JNU campus in February, 2016, sparking a national debate on freedom of expression and nationalism.Bhim Sen Bassi was commissioner of the Delhi police when several students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, including Kumar, were charged with sedition for alleged anti-India cries.POLICE YET TO FILE CASEBut an India Today investigation has found police have yet to file a formal chargesheet in the case that involved charges as serious as sedition. Bassi and his successor Alok Verma have, in the meantime, moved on from the city's police force.A senior special-cell officer, requesting anonymity, said, ""We are trying to connect the lose ends and are in the process of filing a chargesheet."" The officer added that it would be incorrect to say there is no evidence against accused in the case.Top sources in the Delhi police's special cell, which is investigating the matter, have revealed they sent as many as 40 video samples of the controversial JNU event for forensic examinationMost of the footage, they said, have been found to be authentic.Also read: If Afzal Guru is terrorist, so is Godse: Kanhaiya KumarUMAR KHALID MAY HAVE RAISED ANTI-INDIA CRIESAnti-India sloganeering did ring through the JNU campus that day, but Kumar's voice has tested negative in the forensic tests, highly-placed special-cell sources revealed.Kumar, the investigators said, had reached the scene after a clash broke out between JNU students and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad activists.But lab examinations have identified nine students as possible slogan-shouters, including Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, special-cell sources said.Most of the other slogan shouters were Kashmiri students from several universities, Jamia Millia Islamia and the Aligarh Muslim University included, according to special-cell officials.But no FIR has since been lodged against the Kashmiri suspects, they said.Also read: Ramjas violence: Campus politics turning colleges into battlegrounds, hurting academic freedom?KANHAIYA: HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED MY INNOCENCEIndia Today spoke to Kanhaiya Kumar, who said he has not seen this report, but added that he has always maintained that he has been wrongly implicated.

"Google's head of connectivity in India recently talked about the Google RailTel, which has started providing free WiFi at 140 railway stations in India. ""If you compare this with Wi-Fi in London and San Francisco, you will find that the Wi-Fi is better in both coverage and capacity"", he said. The initiative aims to cover 400 stations across the country.","Summarise: As a part of Prime Minister Modi's Digital India initiative, the Indian Railways have partnered with Google to provide Wi-Fi broadband facility to passengers at major railway stations across the country. This Google RailTel initiative was launched in January 2016 and till date has reached 140 stations across India. Their lofty aim is to reach 400 stations by 2018.Under this initiative, RailTel, a subsidiary of the government of India provides the high speed network via Fiber while Google sets up the wireless infrastructure and provides tech support. The speeds on offer range from 20-40Mbps for 30 minutes after which they are gradually reduced in order to manage bandwidth.The India Today Tech had the opportunity to experience Google's RailTel initiative first hand at Nizamuddin Railway station. We also interviewed Gulzar AzadÂ  -- head of connectivity, Google India -- who spoke about the partnership with RailTel, the challenges faced in bringing high-speed Wi-Fi to 140 of India's major railway stations, what Google and RailTel have learnt along the way and the road ahead for this ambitious initiative.Q: This initiative started before Jio revolutionised the telecom sector with its disruptive plans and brought 4G to the masses. Have you seen a dip in the daily usage since Jio entered the marketplace? Has the widespread and cheap availability of 4G data since the entry of Jio affected Google's RailTel strategy in any way?This is a great question. Very relevant in today's time. What we have seen is that as 4G has emerged, we have seen no dip in the Wi-Fi usage. If you talk about the time when 'free' 4G started emerging, we were at about 5 million (50 lakh) monthly active users, today we are at 6.5 million (65 lakh) monthly active users. So the RailTel initiative has only grown since then.The railway station is a great point of convergence. At this point of convergence, there is the need for multiple networks and multiple systems to satisfy the user demand. Before the advent of 'free' 4G, people were not even thinking of consuming 1GB data a month, let alone 1GB data a day.The mark of telecommunication development of any country is how close the Fiber is to the user. In effect, you must see that the Wi-Fi that we are implementing is an attempt to bring Fiber close to the user. And that is working pretty well for us.Q: During my interactions with passengers and workers at the Nizzamudin railway station, I found out that many of them feel that during peak hours the speed slows down quite a bit. Is that something you are looking into?I feel that is also a very interesting, emerging phenomenon. If you see when we started the project, even at peak hours the speed we were giving the users was very satisfactory and now people want more. This is exactly what we were expecting. Once people start experiencing high-speed internet, the user behavior changes - the expectation now is higher. There is more demand for less and less latency in the network.The good news for us is that across the last twelve months, we have not seen a dip in monthly active users. The average usage still remains 350MB per user per session which shows we have augmented the network and capacity while adding more users.As 4G has emerged, we have seen no dip in the Wi-Fi usage. If you talk about the time when 'free' 4G started emerging, we were at about 5 million monthly active users, today we are at 6.5 million monthly active usersMr Gulzar Azad then spoke about how Google is taking steps to make the RailTel initiative financially viableSince April, we have made the login process Ad supported and that is helping RailTel from an ISP perspective. The revenue is majorly meant for RailTel. We have a revenue share mechanism which is expected as we are a contributor to the project itself - Google helps build the wireless (infrastructure) and RailTel brings in the Fibre and the connectivity.Q:The RailTel initiative was in the news a couple of months ago as it was found that it was being used for watching porn in many railway stations. Were any measures put into place after that?The idea of the internet here from an experience point of view is to make it the same internet that you and I have and for that internet to be available to everyone. That is the singular goal of our vision - for a billion people to experience the internet you and I experience in our homes, in our offices.Â  And when we do that, we are following the regulations set by the country.The ISP (RailTel) follows the regulations from the government in terms of what's allowed on the internet and what's not. This internet is not different from every other internet across the country.Q: If we talk about the speed, I was told that 1Mbps is the minimum speed even when the 30 limit high speed cap is crossed. Is that a realistic claim?The way the network has been set up there is actually no speed limit before or after. The design of the network is such that in the first 30 minute time limit, we allow the user to get unfettered access - the idea is to get all users to a point where they could access high quality HD video streams.After the time limit is crossed, we make sure that everybody does still have internet and the net is still low latency. We are adjusting the network dynamically so that people can still access the internet but in the first half an hour they can access HD quality video streams.Q: But what is the minimum speed? - I spoke to many people and got a lot of varying replies. Some people said it is as bad as 128kbps but others said they can stream video for 24 hours.The quality of your internet is not just measured by the speed. It is also measured by the latency of the network. We have designed the network in a way that even when the network is at low speed, it is still a low latency network. The internet is dynamically configured in such a way that you will still be able perform certain use cases (like opening a search page, running apps like WhatsApp and Messenger) after the high-speed cap gets over after 30 minutes.This is a great advancement. If you compare this with Wi-Fi in London and San Francisco, you will find that the Wi-Fi is better in both coverage and capacityNote: The network is dynamically adjusted in such a way that priority is given to those who are logging in for the first time. This is why the 30 minute high-speed cap exists. During our time at the Nizamuddin railway station we got average speeds of 17-18mpbs (download) during the 30 minute unfettered limit. Also, we found out that all access points are already dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz capable) in order to cope with future demand.Q: What is the business model that Google and RailTel are following? How is Google benefiting from this project?For Google, this is an ecosystem project. Our idea with this is to make sure there is more and more broadband adoption. The more the adoption, the more people come online, and the greater the economic impact.When there is economic impact on digitisation, we get directly impacted because we are a stakeholder in the digitisation of the country. Also, the more people use internet, the more they use e-commerce, social networks, news websites and eventually Google services.Q: At the Nizamuddin railway station and the New Delhi railway station, which I visited a few weeks ago, the advertising is quite minimal. Also a lot of people, even in tier 1 cities like Delhi and Mumbai are unaware of this initiative. So what is Google and RailTel's future plans regarding awareness?Addressing awareness of Wi-Fi is certainly an important issue and we need the help of the Indian railways and the government to do that more and more. As you can see, the Wi-Fi is already free, so there is not much space for businesses to market on it. But the Indian Railways who host this, they should be partnering with us to make more and more awareness happen.There are various channels of awareness. We have tried audio announcements and visuals. We have also tried having agents at the station. I think to raise awareness in a sustainable way we need help from the government."

"The US House of Representatives on Tuesday voted 419-3 to approve new sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential elections, despite President Donald Trump objecting to the legislation. The bill would also levy new sanctions against North Korea and Iran over the nations' ballistic missile programs. White House officials said they are reviewing the bill.","Summarise: The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted on Tuesday to approve new sanctions on Russia, setting up a potential showdown with the White House.By a 419-3 vote, the House approved a bill to that would levy new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. It combines new measures targeting Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, as well as provisions intended to curb North Korea?s nuclear weapons program and Iranian militarism.Only three libertarian-leaning Republicans ? Justin Amash of Michigan, Tom Massie of Kentucky and Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee ? voted against the bill in the House.The bill had been bogged down in controversy in recent weeks over objections from the Trump administration. The White House has been opposed to a provision in the bill that requires congressional approval for any attempt by the president to lift the sanctions on Russia.An earlier Senate version of the bill passed 98-2, but was only aimed at Russia and Iran. It did not include the measures against North Korea, which are now in the House bill. The latest bill must now return to the Senate, where it is expected to pass easily, before it is sent to Trump.Despite the White House?s opposition to the bill, it is likely to become law. Even if Trump decides to veto the legislation, it has already passed both chambers by veto-proof margins.In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that ?while the President supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the President?s desk?.The legislation passed the House the same day Trump?s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, spoke to the House intelligence committee about the Trump campaign?s ties to Russia. Russian interference in the 2016 election is the subject of multiple investigations ? including one by special counsel Robert Mueller ? as well as committees on Capitol Hill, and questions have been raised in particular about allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has vigorously denied the suggestion that there was any collusion and has repeatedly called the investigations into Russia?s role in the election ?a witch hunt?."
"The Taapsee Pannu and Amit Sadh starrer 'Running Shaadi', which released on Friday, ""is great in patches..."", wrote India Today. Hindustan Times wrote, ""The film has its moments, but they're too few to keep you engrossed"", while Times of India said, ""The story is funny...the performances up to the mark."" It was rated 3/5 (India Today, TOI) and 2/5 (HT).","Summarise: Running Shaadi is the story of a bunch of small town entrepreneurs who start a website to help couples elope and marry. Here is our Running Shaadi movie review.Running Shaadi Cast: Amit Sadh, Taapsee Pannu, Arsh BajwaRunning Shaadi Direction: Amit RoyRunning Shaadi Rating: (3/5)Running Shaadi, previously known as Runningshaadi.com but not anymore because Shaadi.com approached Bombay High Court protesting against the title, is a film that is great in patches but is mostly just about okay.The story of Running Shaadi involves Ram Bharose (Amit Sadh) and Nimmi (Taapsee Pannu), a boy and girl who grow up together in Punjab and after a fallout with his boss, Ram joins hands with his friend 'Cyberjeet' (the excellent Arsh Bajwa) to start a website called Runningshaadi.com that organises all that an everyday eloping couple from India would need. Nimmi joins the duo but soon enough, the romantic tension between her and Ram takes the story through unexpected turns.MOVIE REVIEW: THE GHAZI ATTACKWatch Running Shaadi trailer here:Running Shaadi was ready two years ago, but the distributors could never find a suitable window to release it. That is unfortunate because within those two years, films like Dolly Ki Doli and Happy Bhag Jayegi released. As such, conceptually, the film seems dated. While watching the film, you would get shades of Band Baaja Baaraat (two unlikely small-towners getting together to become entrepreneurs), and of course, the aforementioned films because there's the entire 'runaway bride' angle.Nevertheless, there is a lot that works for Running Shaadi. And that 'lot' is pretty much the excellent casting.Amit Sadh as the ambitious and resourceful Ram Bharose gives a career-defining performance as the lead. He is what they call 'lambi race ka ghoda.' Amit gets to showcase a range of emotions in Running Shaadi and he never, ever falters. He is so good. Hopefully, he gets noticed in Running Shaadi for all his worth.Then, there's Arsh Bajwa as the goofy but smart tech geek Sarabjeet AKA Cyberjeet. The scenes of him worshipping Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg and that funny-for-a-while red turban with the image of a Facebook 'Like' button on it seem forced but that does not take away from Arsh's grade-A supporting act.Taapsee Pannu gets a very tricky, complicated character, Nimmi. Nimmi is the kind of girl who you will never want to make a team-member if you have to rob a bank. She cons Ram Bharose in the most unexpected manner right before the interval and one will be hard-pressed to sympathise or empathise with her. However, Ram, who has been established as a 'sorted' dude, for some reason, continues to willingly jump into near-fatal situations for her. Is love a good enough reason to justify unconvincing character development?Watch 'Mannerless Majnu' from Running Shaadi:Three entire paragraphs are devoted to the film's actors because that is how much they hold the story together. Because without them, the plot falls apart. Running Shaadi is made of an err...running chain of unbelievable plot twists but we will suspend our disbelief simply because of the strength of its actors.Debutant director Amit Roy, who has previously been a cinematographer for Ram Gopal Varma's very uniquely-shot movies such as the Sarkar films, Nishabd and Rann, has the potential to make a great second film. Running Shaadi on paper seems trite, but it is consistently engaging because newer and wilder plot developments get thrown at you (Roy is also the writer) and you cannot help but continue to run with its characters to find out what eventually becomes of them.In a week packed with multiple Bollywood and Hollywood releases, will Running Shaadi get noticed, more so, by the right people? An extra star for Amit, Taapse and Arsh.(The writer tweets as @devarsighosh.)"

Karnataka Water Resources Minister MB Patil has said that the state has just enough water for drinking purposes till June 15. Patil also urged the people of Karnataka to use water judiciously. The state has been reeling under a severe drought for the past three years and available live storage in the state's reservoirs has reached an all-time low.,"Summarise: Karnataka water resources minister MB Patil has appealed to the state's denizens to use water judiciously, reminding them that there's just enough water for drinking purposes till June 15.Patil today held a meeting with officials belonging to various departments, to work out how best to optimally use water until the onset of the monsoon. With Karnataka reeling under a severe drought for the past three years, the state government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that citizens aren't facing too much trouble. But with the available live storage in the reservoirs touching an all-time low, there's very little the government can do to supply continuous drinking water.As of today, this is the level of water in the state's reservoirs.- Almatti dam: 12 TMC (TMC - one thousand million cubic feet)- Narayanapura dam: 15 TMC- Hidkal dam: 7.6 TMC- Hipparge dam : 0.8 TMC- Malaprabha dam: 1.7 TMC- Tungabhadra dam: 3.7 TMC- Bhadra: 8.5 TMC- KRS: 4.438 TMC- Kabini dam: 0.295 TMC- Harangi dam: 1.228 TMC- Hemavathi dam: 1.787 TMCWATER RATIONING BEGINS?""We will coordinate with different departments and ensure that as a team there will be efficient use of water,"" Patil said. However, he hinted that agencies such as Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), KWSSB and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department (RDPR) can take a decision on rationing water. Similarly, district administrations can stop farmers from utilizing pumpsets, since Patil said, ""there's is water for agricultural purposes and what we have is only for drinking."" WATER SHORTAGE IN BENGALURUThe problem that Bengaluru is suffering today is due to the fact that only a third of the city gets Cauvery water on a daily basis, as per the tribunal's orders. The other parts of the city make do with borewells and water tankers. ""We have allocated around 9 TMC of water to the peripheral areas of the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) but that will take time,"" Patil said.He added that the BWSSB and BBMP would manage that issue in due course of time.Patil said that in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya and surrounding areas, water is being supplied at 800 cusecs per day, and this should suffice till June 15. The KRS dam and the Kabini dam together have around 4.7 TMC, and the requirement for 60 days will be around 4.5 TMC, which is manageable, he said.ALSO READ | Bengaluru 'water warriors' challenge citizens in city to be 'water kanjoos' this summer "
"The Samajwadi Party has called UP CM Yogi Adityanath's government an ""inquiry committee"" after the CBI started investigating nearly half a dozen projects launched by former CM Akhilesh Yadav. ""It's engaging in politics of vendetta, and more so to smokescreen its failures in delivering on the pre-poll promises,"" chief SP spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhury said.","Summarise: By Abhinav Pandey Lucknow, Jun 25 (PTI) With nearly half a dozen projects launched by former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav under the CBI scanner, the SP has attacked the Adityanath government saying it has reduced itself into an ""inquiry committee"". As the states BJP government completes 100 days in the office in the next few days, a Samajwadi Party spokesperson said it was resorting to such tactics to ""smokescreen its failures"". ""It smacks of politics of vendetta,"" partys chief spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhury told PTI here. It reflects that the state government relies more on central investigating agencies, like the CBI, than on its own machinery for carrying out any probe, he alleged. Since taking office on March 19, the Adityanath government has recommended CBI probes into several projects of the previous Samajwadi Party regime led by Akhilesh Yadav. These include alleged irregularities in the functioning of Shia and Sunni waqf boards, Akhileshs dream project of Gomti riverfront development, mobile creche scheme, and also into the death of Karnataka-based IAS officer Anurag Tiwari in Lucknow last month. Besides, acting on an Allahabad High Court directive, the state government has recommended a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the construction of Delhi-Saharanpur Yamunotri highway. ""It seems the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh has become an inquiry committee. Its engaging in politics of vendetta, and more so to smokescreen its failures in delivering on the pre-poll promises,"" Chowdhury said. In its probe into alleged irregularities in the Yamunotri highway construction, the UP Police found out that Rs 455 crore were siphoned off by a Hyderabad-based firm, which undertook the project, in connivance with staff of 14 banks and some chartered accountants (CAs). It told the government that since offices of the financial institutions, the CAs and the construction firms were located in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and other parts of the country, it would be better to get it probed by some central agency. After an internal probe, a CBI inquiry was recommended last month, Principal Secretary (Home) Arvind Kumar said. The CBI has also registered an FIR to probe alleged irregularities of funds into the Rs 1,100-crore Sachal Palnagriha Yojana (mobile creche). The scheme was launched by the Akhilesh government to provide creche facilities to children, aged six and below, of women labourers engaged in the construction sector. The scheme, supposed to involve NGOs, aimed at providing nutritious food, entertainment and educational facilities to children. It is alleged that officials of the states Social Welfare, Building and Constructions Department connived with NGOs to divert funds. The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court had handed over the case to the CBI, saying there was a need to probe the alleged misappropriation and defalcation of public money during the implementation of the scheme. The court had observed the state government departments were ""shifting blame"" onto each other. The CBI has booked unidentified officials of the UP State Social Welfare Board, the UP Building and Construction Workers? Welfare Board and several NGOs in this case. ""The CM does not trust his own police when it comes to probe. The Adityanath government seems to rely more on CBI than on Uttar Pradesh police,"" the SP spokesperson said. The state government also recommended a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the working of the Shia and Sunni waqf boards. UP MoS for Waqf Mohsin Raza said the alleged scam came to the fore in a probe by the Waqf Council of India (WCI). The role of Shia Waqf Boards chairman Wasim Rizvi and that of the Minister for Waqf in the SP government Azam Khan have also come under the scanner after the WCI inquiry. Khan has, however, maintained he is ""absolutely clean"" and the allegations against him were baseless. The UP government is also contemplating to recommend a CBI probe into various anomalies in the Gomti Riverfront Development Project- a dream project of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. ""Just a couple of days back, a (Gomti Riverfront) probe report was submitted to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. All necessary steps will be taken and appropriate action initiated for a CBI probe,"" MoS, Urban Development, Girish Kumar Yadav told PTI. On April 1, the chief minister had ordered an inquiry by a retired high court judge in the project. The decision came after urban development officials told the CM that of the total allocation of Rs 1,513 crore, 95 per cent (around Rs 1,435 crore) had already been spent but less than 60 per cent of the work has been completed. Some other SP government projects under the scanner are land acquisition for Agra-Lucknow expressway, the Yash Bharti awards Samajwadi pension scheme, ration cards distribution, claiming ""fake"" fix deposits to get PWD contracts in Etah.

"Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said the government's proposal to auction spectrum every year whether industry needs it or not is ""very progressive thought"". ""In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide,"" Mittal added. Earlier, Telecom Secretary JS Deepak said the government is looking to make spectrum auction an annual event and will seek TRAI's recommendations.","Summarise: From Prasoon Srivastava Barcelona, Mar 2 (PTI) The governments proposal to auction spectrum every year has got a backer in Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, who however has said there is no need for sale of airwaves in coming fiscal. ""The way he (telecom secretary) has put it that spectrum auction will be done every year whether industry needs it or not is very progressive thought. In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide,"" Mittal told PTI in an interview. J S Deepak, as the Telecom Secretary, a couple of days ago said the government is looking at making spectrum auction an annual event and will reach out to sector regulator Trai for its recommendations. He had said the government plans to provide industry with an option to buy spectrum every year irrespective of their interest so that there is never a shortage of spectrum in providing quality mobile services. Deepak, a 1982-batch IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh, who at present is at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, has been shifted with ""immediate effect"" from the telecom ministry and made officer on special duty in the commerce department. Mittal recently pitched for affordability in spectrum pricing that has gone ""out of control"" in the last few years, saying the spectrum surplus industry will not need an airwave auction at least in 2017-18. He, however, has said that even though telecom operators are bleeding with the entrance of a new service provider, they will need to increase investment in networks to handle competition. ""You have to accelerate market spends. You need to put more capex. We have done 85,000 base stations last year, 80,000 base stations this year. This is largest rollout anywhere in the world. There will be more investment on 4G side,"" Mittal said. Bharti Airtel had reported an over 54 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 503.7 crore for the December quarter due to what it had termed as ""turbulence from predatory pricing by a new operator"". The Indian telecom czar said Bharti Airtels balancesheet remains ""healthy and strong"" and he does not think Bharti will go into losses under competitive pressure although one can ""never say never"". He maintained that with improvement in technology, the cost of network is not linear. Mittal further said Huawei and ZTE have a massive mimo technology using which one can quadruple or probably go up to 8 times of existing capacities in the spectrum. ""Nice good innovation is happening on the network side where you can generate nice good capacities than in the past. Technology is also coming to help. Its not that if I have got 2000 TB of capacity and I have to move to 5000, I have to double my investments. Its probably 20 per cent more,"" Mittal said. "

The sahayak jawans will be moved to army formations and replaced by civilians.","Summarise: The Indian Army, after consultations with the Defence Ministry, is considering cutting down the numbers of its sahayaks or 'buddies' by 25 percent. This would translate to around 10,000 jawans as there are currently about 40,000 sahayaks in the Indian Army. The move would come in the wake of the controversy over the tasks Indian Army sahayaks perform for officers and junior commissioned officers.Under the army's 'buddy's system, sahayak jawans are attached to officers and junior commissioned officers. A sahayak's tasks include working with the officer or JCO for army-related duties. According to top army sources, the 10,000 sahayak jawans will be replaced by civilians. The civilian substitutes will be employed for officers in static formations such as the Army Headquarters or units in the Delhi area and not operational locations like battalions, brigades and division and corps headquarters.

An Interior Ministry spokesperson said that the Pakistan spy agency's role in the blast has been established, adding that India suffers from Pakistan-sponsored terror too. ","Summarise: Afghanistan has blamed Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the banned terror group - the Haqqani network - for Wednesday's deadly bomb blast in Kabul's diplomatic area which killed at least 90 people and injured 300 others.Talking exclusively to India Today, Afghanistan Interior Ministry spokesperson Sediq Siddiqui said role of Pakistan's ISI has been established in Kabul explosion. ""We have nailed Pakistan's ISI role (in Kabul blast). Afghanistan expects Pakistan to crack down on Haqqani network. The attack will surely impact ties between the two (Afghanistan, Pakistan) countries,"" Siddiqui told India Today. He added that Kabul expects Islamabad to act against theÂ  Haqqani network while expressing fears of more such attacks in the country.India and Pakistan both are victims of Pakistan sponsored terror, Siddiqui added. The Haqqani Network is an Afghan insurgent terror outfit based in Pakistan's Waziristan and has carried out many high-profile attacks on US forces, high ranking Afghan officials and foreigners in Afghanistan. The network has ties with Taliban and Al Qaeda and the US considers it a major threat to Afghanistan's stability.KABUL ATTACK Kabul's high-security diplomatic zone was rocked by a powerful blast on Wednesday morning. The explosion occurred near the German embassy at one of the entrances to Kabul's unofficial Green Zone.While the sewage tanker carrying the bomb was stopped from entering the zone, it was unclear how such a large quantity of explosives could get through the ring of checkpoints set up around Kabul to protect the capital.A huge crater ripped into the ground at the site of the blast and shattered windows in houses more than a kilometre away were testament to the power of the explosion, which was set off by a bomb concealed in the tanker.In scale, it was one of the worst such attacks since the US-led campaign to oust the Taliban in 2001 but in kind, it was only the latest in a grim series that has killed thousands of civilians over the years.(With inputs from Reuters) ALSO READ:Kabul bomb blast death toll hits 80, over 350 others injured in suicide attack near Indian embassy"

With over 34,000 runs to his name in his international career, Tendulkar is regarded as arguably the best batsman in the history of the game with comparisons drawn alongside the legendary Sir Don Bradman. It isn?t a secret anymore that Tendulkar wanted to be a fast bowler at one point, but that didn?t happen, and instead he rolled his arms as a part-time leg-spinner later in his career.READ?| Ravichandran Ashwin fastest to 250 Test scalps, breaks Dennis Lillee?s recordIn a video posted on Facebook by Tendulkar late on Tuesday night, he wishes Lillee on his birthday before stating: ?I can?t ever forget the day I met you in Chennai in 1987. I was there to become a fast bowler, but this is something most of the guys don?t know. I was always a batter but while catching the train from Mumbai to Chennai, my brother told me ?It won?t be a bad idea to carry your batting gear because after bowling for a while, you might be standing there doing nothing. And that time you can pad up and play against all those fast bowlers.? I actually ended up doing that for the rest of the week. You correctly said ?I think this young lad should go out and bat and forget about bowling.??Well, Lillee seemed to have seen the talent hidden in that 16-year-old back then and the rest is history. However, Tendulkar admits that it wasn?t the end of his dreams of becoming a fast bowler and added: ?But that desire continued and instead of bowling in matches, I used to fulfill all my desires at the nets, bowling from 17 yards (and) sometimes also pretended to be a Dennis Lillee at the nets.?"

In addition, this approach, focusing on universal coverage of free publicly financed PHC services, closely matches the UHC strategy recommended by India?s high level expert group which reported to the previous federal government in 2011,? the memorandum read.The number of suggestions to further reform the health project includes undertaking a formal evaluation of the Mohalla Clinics programme, improve management information systems for maintaining patients? records and better monitoring, and lastly, scaling up preventive and community based services. The memorandum argued that the PHC is more than treating illness -- it should also involve services to prevent people falling sick."

"A 95-year-old widow of an Indian Air Force pilot, who died in a plane crash in 1962, waited 55 years to get the due special pension. In 2004, her appeal got rejected, saying her husband had already availed the insurance benefits.

A military court finally gave her justice.Squadron Leader JM Lowe was a test pilot in the Air Force on deputation with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and died on June 19, 1962 in a flying accident. His widow with her four-year-old child had been fighting since then for the dues.THE INCIDENTThe accident occurred 55 years ago in Bengaluru while the pilot was test-flying the Gnat aircraft, which developed severe mechanical failure witnessed as ""violent pitch oscillations"" prior to delivery to the IAF.""Despite the fact that the officer's widow is entitled to special family pension, the government in September 2004 rejected her appeal by giving an illogical reason that under the terms of deputation the applicant had already availed the benefits of insurance,"" Lowe's counsel Wing Commander Ajay Bhalla told Mail Today.Kamla Lowe also had to wait nine years for getting the ordinary pension and had to suffer a lot because of the lack of it, her husband's case revealed.The lady had also been fruitlessly writing letters to various authorities concerned to get her dues from the government.The government countered her by saying that she could not be given the special pension as her husband had opted for an insurance scheme before his death and also opposed the plea in the Armed Forces Tribunal, saying that she had come for justice after 55 years and her plea should dismissed on the basis of delay in approaching the court.The government also told the court that finding papers of the family pension granted to the widow of the officer and documents related to his deputation to HAL also could not be found as the matter was very old.""Pained"" by the sufferings of the IAF officer's widow, the tribunal bench headed by Chairperson Justice Virendra Singh said, ""Apart from the awful trauma of losing her husband, and having to bring up her four-year-old child, all alone, we observe that for almost nine years this widow was not even granted the basic right of ordinary family pension.""

"Stanford scientists have used the smallest possible diamond bits (diamondoids) to assemble atoms into three-atom-wide electrical wires. The core of each block of the nanowire is formed by copper and sulphur atoms, while diamondoids form the insulating outer shell. The technique could be used for making fabrics that produce electricity and optoelectronic devices that employ both current and light.","Summarise: Boston, Dec 27 (PTI) Scientists have used the smallest possible bits of diamonds to assemble electrical wires just three atoms wide, an advance that could pave the way for fabrics that generate electricity. By grabbing various types of atoms and putting them together LEGO-style, the new technique could potentially be used to build tiny wires for a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic devices that employ both electricity and light and superconducting materials that conduct electricity without any loss. ""What we have shown here is that we can make tiny, conductive wires of the smallest possible size that essentially assemble themselves,"" said Hao Yan, postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in the US. ""The process is a simple, one-pot synthesis. You dump the ingredients together and you can get results in half an hour. Its almost as if the diamondoids know where they want to go,"" said Yan. This animation shows molecular building blocks joining the tip of a growing nanowire. Each block consists of a diamondoid - the smallest bit of diamond - attached to sulphur and copper atoms. Like LEGO blocks, they only fit together in certain ways that are determined by their size and shape. The copper and sulphur atoms form a conductive wire in the middle, and the diamondoids form an insulating outer shell. Although there are other ways to get materials to self-assemble, this is the first one shown to make a nanowire with a solid, crystalline core that has good electronic properties, said Nicholas Melosh, from the US Department of Energys SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The needle-like wires have a semiconducting core - a combination of copper and sulphur known as a chalcogenide - surrounded by the attached diamondoids, which form an insulating shell. Their size is important because a material that exists in just one or two dimensions - as atomic-scale dots, wires or sheets - can have very different, extraordinary properties compared to the same material made in bulk, Melosh said. The new method allows researchers to assemble those materials with atom-by-atom precision and control. The diamondoids they used as assembly tools are tiny, interlocking cages of carbon and hydrogen. Found naturally in petroleum fluids, they are extracted and separated by size and geometry in a SLAC laboratory. For this study, the research team took advantage of the fact that diamondoids are strongly attracted to each other, through what are known as van der Waals forces. They started with the smallest possible diamondoids - single cages that contain just 10 carbon atoms - and attached a sulphur atom to each. "

"In a company-wide email, Tesla CEO Elon Musk told employees that it's ""obviously not cool"" when ""someone in a less represented group"" sues Tesla for millions of dollars because they felt they weren't promoted enough. The email was reportedly sent a few days after Tesla fired a female engineer who accused the automaker of ignoring her sexual harassment complaints. ","Summarise: The theme for this year?s International Women?s Day was ?be bold for change? in the fight for a ?more gender inclusive world? ? but some at Tesla had a different plan for the day. It was an opportunity for women to discover essential oils. A ?health and wellness group? at the electric car company invited female staff members to an 8 March ?lunch ?n learn? about oils and how they can help improve people?s ?health and happiness?, according to emails seen by the Guardian, which reveal that the proposed event was quickly met with vocal criticism. It was particularly offensive to some given that a week earlier, AJ Vandermeyden, a female engineer, had publicly accused Elon Musk?s company of sexual harassment and discrimination.Tesla postponed the oils session. The company organized a town hall meeting on diversity for that day, which included six male executives and one woman, according to multiple attendees. At the crowded meeting at the Fremont factory, women took the microphone one-by-one and shared stories of sexual harassment, mistreatment by male managers, unfair promotion decisions and more, sources said.Vandermeyden, who attended the meeting, thought the outpouring of comments validated her own story. But soon after, Tesla fired her, accusing her of pursuing a ?miscarriage of justice? by filing a lawsuit that alleged ?pervasive harassment? and pay discrimination. Testimony from the town hall ? along with internal emails from Musk, and Vandermeyden?s first interview since her termination ? paint a picture of a company that has struggled to respond to mounting complaints about gender discrimination and has aggressively attempted to discredit a woman who publicly criticized it .?They just want to absolutely crush anyone who speaks up,? said Vandermeyden, 33, seated inside her attorney?s San Francisco office on a recent afternoon. ?I spoke up, and I was made a sacrificial lamb for it. It?s a scary precedent.?Vandermeyden detailed the painful experience of losing a job she loved while facing harsh personal attacks by Tesla in the media. She has come forward at a time when the tech industry is grappling with high profile sexual misconduct scandals at Uber, a prominent venture capital firm and a popular startup incubator.Tesla, known internationally for its battery-powered vehicles and self-driving car technology, has strongly rejected Vandermeyden?s claims, saying she was terminated for ?falsely attacking our company in the press?. But the flurry of criticisms that emerged at the town hall suggests that her complaints are not unique.Musk was not at the meeting, which was attended by roughly 70-100 people, and featured comments from more than 20 women, according to Vandermeyden and another attendee. One woman described parts of the factory as a ?predator zone? for harassment. When the moderator asked women in the room if they had ever been catcalled, a significant number of women raised their hands, according to Vandermeyden.Other women allegedly talked about feeling unsafe around male managers and facing sexist remarks from superiors. Women talked about being dismissed and talked over in meetings with no other female employees, and asked questions about diversity in hiring and the lack of women in leadership positions.Some of the executives seemed genuinely concerned and taken aback by the women?s comments. One male leader said it was unacceptable, noting that he had daughters, said Vandermeyden.One female manager, who was present but no longer works for Tesla, told the Guardian she was offended by that comment: ?It?s insulting. You shouldn?t have to have daughters to know this.? She said executives? responses to questions about diversity were generic and filled with corporate jargon.Tesla said in an email that a Women in Tesla group hosted the event and that ?executives attended because they wanted to hear directly from employees about their experiences and learn about how to improve the workplace?. The company disputed the Guardian?s characterization of the meeting, saying: ?Employees stood up to ask the executives questions, share their experiences at Tesla ? both positive and negative ? while others spoke of things that they believed Tesla was doing right and some came with suggestions. In some instances, employees were only looking for better collaboration with their HR business partners in general and had nothing to do with any allegations of harassment.?The company statement said that when an employee referenced an area of the factory as a ?predator zone?, it ?surprised many in the room who had never heard of this term?. Immediately after the meeting, Tesla said it sent a factory-wide message to supervisors about its ?strict policy against any kind of harassment?, adding, ?Any complaints of catcalling in the factory are thoroughly investigated and action is taken where necessary.?Tesla also said that at the meeting, ?there was a lot of energy around ensuring we are proactively sourcing diverse talent and ensuring that we have an interview and assessment process that is free from bias?.Vandermeyden said she talked briefly about her experience at the meeting, adding: ?It was finally giving women a venue to voice what was going on. It felt like Tesla had been saying I?m making all this up. And here were all the women saying, ?No, it?s happening.? It?s too big to deny.?Her lawsuit, filed last year, alleged that after she was hired in 2013, she was promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in a department that consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly assumed. Men were also granted positions over her, and she and other women were denied promotions despite their equal or superior qualifications, the complaint said. She also said that Tesla retaliated against her after she raised concerns about sexual harassment and catcalls she routinely faced on the factory floor. Vandermeyden went public with her story in an interview with the Guardian in February, prompting Tesla to vehemently deny her allegations, claiming that an internal investigation concluded that there was no harassment, discrimination or retaliation.On 23 May, Tesla announced the hiring of Gaby Toledano as the new chief people officer to oversee HR amid growing concerns about unsafe working conditions at the factory. Toledano joined as the only woman in the ?c-suite?, meaning group of chief executives.One of her first major acts was to fire Vandermeyden. I?m the one who spoke up, and they?re saying, ?One way or another, you have to leave.? How is that right?Toledano asked Vandermeyden to meet for coffee one-on-one without lawyers on 29 May, the Memorial Day holiday. Vandermeyden said she thought it was an opportunity to discuss ways to improve the workplace and address her concerns, but instead she was told she could resign and get a severance package or she would be terminated immediately and should not show up for work the next day.?It felt like they were trying to intimidate me. I?m the one who spoke up, and they?re saying, ?One way or another, you have to leave.? How is that right?? Vandermeyden recalled in the recent interview. Toledano?s message to her was clear, she added: ??You can end this now or this is going to be litigation going on for years.??She refused to resign and was fired, she said. She has yet to return to Tesla to clean out her desk.Tesla disputed Vandermeyden?s account of the meeting, saying: ?Gaby did not intimidate Ms Vandermeyden. She disagrees that there was any intimidation, nor did Ms Vandermeyden ever express feeling intimidated during the meeting. In fact, they both had a positive rapport and expressed mutual support, as Gaby was new to her role at Tesla and was attempting to resolve the matter in a positive and mutually supportive manner for the company and for Ms Vandermeyden.?Vandermeyden struggled to process the news and was further shocked when Tesla released a 430-word statement to the Guardian justifying the termination. ?Vandermeyden was given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications, and that negatively impacted other more qualified individuals,? the statement said, saying that she behaved in a ?fundamentally false and misleading manner?. The company said she ?falsely attacked? Tesla in the press, amounting to a ?miscarriage of justice?, adding: ?It is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner.?Her lawyer, Therese Lawless, well known for fighting discrimination in Silicon Valley, said the statement was clear evidence that Tesla?s termination was retaliation for raising concerns about workplace conditions, which is her legally protected right.In addition to saying she was not qualified for her job, Tesla has also repeatedly noted that Vandermeyden did not have an engineering degree, a fact many tech journalists have repeated in articles. But according to Vandermeyden and another Tesla employee, this is not uncommon; she said she knew of at least two male engineers in her department without a degree.  Musk also appeared to reference Vandermeyden in a company-wide email sent two days after her termination. In the email ? with the subject ?Doing the right thing?, sent at 2.29am ? Musk lamented the scrutiny that his company faces, saying, ?The list of companies that want to kill Tesla is so long, I?ve lost track.?As as a result, he continued, employees must work harder and faster than competitors, adding they can?t be a ?jerk? in the process.Musk did not name Vandermeyden, but went on to offer what seemed to be a thinly veiled attack on her lawsuit: ?If you are part of a less represented group, you don?t get a free pass on being a jerk yourself. We have had a few cases at Tesla where someone in a less represented group was actually given a job or promoted over more qualified highly represented candidates and then decided to sue Tesla for millions of dollars because they felt they weren?t promoted enough. That is obviously not cool.? Vandermeyden, who had not seen the email until the Guardian provided it to her, said it was painful to read: ?It?s saying everything I?ve done at Tesla, all the hard work, it?s dismissing it all. It hurts because there are going to be some people who believe that.?She also noted that she has consistently received positive performance evaluations and called his email ?defamatory?.Asked about the email, Tesla said in a statement: ?This email in fact did not reference Ms Vandermeyden or her case.?Vandermeyden said she wished that Musk would consider that ?dissent isn?t disloyalty? and that her love of Tesla drove her to advocate for better working conditions. ?I was never your enemy,? she said, adding: ?I still believe in the importance of transitioning the world to sustainable energy, but now I don?t get to be a part of it.?She recalled getting a T-shirt with Musk as a superhero when she first joined Tesla, and that it was hard to realize that ?sometimes your superheroes aren?t always super?."

"Investigators have released pictures showing how close an Air Canada flight came to crashing onto four planes at a US airport last month. Its pilots mistakenly descended towards a taxiway, where four planes were parked, instead of the runway before aborting the landing. Investigators said the incident came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst aviation disasters.","Summarise: Newly released data and photos show how shockingly low an Air Canada jet was when it pulled up to avoid crashing into planes waiting on a San Francisco international airport taxiway last month. The Air Canada pilots mistook the taxiway for the runway next to it and flew their jet to just 59ft (18m) above ground before pulling up to attempt another landing, according to National Transportation Safety Board information released on Wednesday.That?s barely taller than the four planes that were on the taxiway when the incident occurred late at night on 7 July. Pilots in a United plane alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet, while the crew of a Philippine Airlines jet behind it switched on their plane?s landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal to Air Canada. NTSB investigators said they have not determined probable cause for the incident that came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst disasters in aviation history.?It was close, much too close,? said John Cox, a safety consultant and retired airline pilot.The investigators said that as the Air Canada jet approached the taxiway just before midnight after a flight from Toronto, it was so far off course that it did not appear on a radar system used to prevent runway collisions.Those systems were not designed to spot planes that are lined up to land on a taxiway a rare occurrence, especially for airline pilots. But the Federal Aviation Administration is working on modifications so they can, agency spokesman Ian Gregor said.Both pilots of the Air Canada Airbus A320 jet were very experienced. The captain, who was flying the plane, had more than 20,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot had about 10,000 hours.The pilots told investigators ?that they did not recall seeing aircraft on taxiway but that something did not look right to them,? the NTSB said.Investigators could not hear what the Air Canada captain and co-pilot said to each other during the aborted landing because their conversation was recorded over when the plane made other flights, starting with a San Francisco-to-Montreal trip the next morning. Recorders are required to capture only the last two hours of a plane?s flying time.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, declined to comment, citing the investigation. "

Over 4,000 resident doctors across Maharashtra have gone on mass leave, agitating against dangerous working conditions. The protest was sparked by an incident last week when the relatives of a deceased patient beat up a resident doctor at Mumbai's Sion Hospital.Addressing the issue behind the agitation, Mahajan said, ""The government will provide 500 guards too civic-run hospitals within five days, 600 guards within 20 days and 1,100 guards within a month."" Â Earlier today, the Birhanmumbai Municipal Corporation issued a notice on the matter, asking 500 resident doctors in Mumbai to resume work or face disciplinary action. The notice warned the doctors that if they fail to resume work, then they could be expelled and their medical registrations could be canceled, as per a January 31, 1996 Government Resolution.Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association's Maharashtra chapter has lent its support to the physicians, expressing 'deep pain' at the ""recent spate of events of unabated violence against doctors.""A letter signed by IMA Maharashtra State's president Dr Ashok Tambe and honorary state secretary Dr Parthiv Sanghvi says, ""We are unable to understand the apathy on the part of the government in not providing an atmosphere free from fear.""""We oppose any action taken against resident doctors and will work to all extents to ensure that they are not victimised.""Dr Sagar, an advisor to the IMA, said they don't want assurances but actual on-the-ground action.

Of the spent money under the Centre?s Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), most of it was used for the Take Home Ration (THR) scheme, which provides ready-to-cook food items to infants from 0 to 3 years, adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women. The THR scheme comes under the ICDS.Several studied have shown that the ready-to-cook food tastes bad, causes indigestion and is mostly fed to cattle and other livestock.?Around 98% of the children did not like the taste of the THR supplements. 40% of the families said that it smelled bad and was difficult to cook.

Amit Narkar of the NCAS has questioned why the government is spending so much on the THR scheme, when reports suggest that the food is not palatable. ?The government needs to give this issue a serious thought,? he has said. Earlier, the state government used to distribute three packets of powdered food, comprising sheera, upma and sattu.Meanwhile, Anganwadi workers and helpers hired by the government to run the ICDS programme have complained that their salaries haven?t been paid. ?Three years ago, the central government cut their funding for ICDS, but the state government did not increase the budget.

"Any 'accidental damage' caused to the Yamuna floodplains' ecology by the Art of Living's cultural event in 2016 has been restored by nature, a scientific report by the organisation has claimed. This is in contradiction to the NGT's report, which claimed that it would take at least 10 years and ?42 crore to fix the damage caused by the event.","Summarise: A scientific report prepared by Art of Living claimed that any ?accidental damage? to the ecology of the Yamuna floodplains caused by the Art of Living?s cultural event in 2016 has already been restored by nature.This contradicts the earlier findings by the National Green Tribunal-appointed seven-member expert committee, which claimed that it would take at least 10 years and Rs42 crore to fix the physical and biological damages caused to the river?s floodplains by the event.?If at all any such accidental damage would have taken place during the event, in all probability they have already been reversed by natural processes. With the arrival of monsoon in 2016, all the lost plants and animals would have re-colonised the event site,? the foundation?s report has claimed. Instead the NGO report has hinted that removal of shrubs, tall grasses, aquatic vegetation and reeds from the event site, which the NGT panel had dubbed as harmful to the floodplains, is actually beneficial to the ecology as it also helped remove invasive exotic species such as water hyacinth.Experts from both the NGT?s panel and the foundation?s team refused to comment on this ongoing war between scientists and experts of the two panels. Art of Living had filed a 200-page parallel report in the NGT to counter the allegations levelled against it. The foundation, founded by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, which has been in the centre of controversy, had roped in at least 15 experts to prepare a scientific report. Experts in the Art of Living?s panel also alleged that satellite images, which forms one of the main pillars of the report submitted by the NGT-appointed panel, has been misinterpreted. The NGT panel had used satellite images and ground reports while claiming that large tracts of wetlands and water bodies were filled up for the event. ?One of the most glaring mistakes made in the report is the declaration of dry farmlands as huge tract of wetlands filled with water and several water bodies etc. Even the agricultural crops have been considered as wetland vegetation with shallow to deep water beneath them,? the NGO?s report has claimed. The experts pointed out that even the Survey of India?s report and National Wetland Atlas prepared by Space Application Centre have no mention of any such wetlands. The atlas had listed around 399 wetlands, including 301 micro wetlands in Delhi alone. The foundation?s report has also challenged the NGT-panel?s allegations that nearly 420 acres of Yamuna floodplains were damaged. Experts questioned how can an event, held over 25 acres of land, damage 420 acres of floodplains.The NGT panel had accused the foundation of levelling and compacting the soil resulting in heavy damage to the floodplains as it stopped the soil?s gaseous exchange and played havoc with the ground water recharging system. Experts who prepared the foundation?s report, however, claimed that compaction if any was done much earlier when construction of guide banks, DND and Barapullah drain were going on. ?It is impossible for even a practicing geophysicist to claim that ground was levelled or compacted without a geophysical study,? says the reports.

A Belgian court has ruled that advertising claims about the health and environmental benefits of a palm oil-free 'Choco' spread by supermarket chain Delhaize were illegal. The case by Nutella manufacturer Ferrero argued that Delhaize's campaign unfairly damaged its iconic brand. Delhaize has now been ordered not to repeat claims about its spread being better for the planet or health.,"Summarise: A Belgian court has ruled that advertising claims about the health and environmental benefits of a palm oil-free ?Choco? spread were illegal, in a case brought against the supermarket chain Delhaize by Ferrero, which manufactures Nutella.Delhaize has been ordered not to repeat any claims about its Choco spread being better for the planet or your health, on pain of a ?25,000 (Â£22,000) fine for each repetition.Ferrero argued that the Delhaize campaign unfairly damaged its iconic Nutella brand, which was placed next to the Choco spread on the supermarket?s shelves.Delhaize, which had won an earlier court case on the issue, told the Guardian it was considering further legal actions but would not appeal the verdict.At issue is a short-lived Delhaize advertising campaign in 2013, which claimed that the Belgian outlet?s best-selling Choco spread was better for the planet and for consumer health because it contained no palm oil. Ferrero argued this implied that firms which used sustainable practices for buying palm oil within existing supply chains were ethically inferior.Greenpeace, which in 2015 rated (pdf) Ferrero one of the best of 14 global manufacturers with ?no deforestation? policies, said the case had turned into a battle of sales strategies.?Ferrero is definitely one of the companies doing its best to implement sustainable commitments,? said An Lambrechts, a Greenpeace Belgium spokeswoman. ?This case is more about marketing ploys and market shares and less about who has the best initiative on palm oil.?Ferrero?s use of palm oil was pushed into the spotlight in 2015 after then-French environment minister SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal called for a consumer boycott of Nutella over deforestation concerns. Royal subsequently backed down from the call, offering the confectionery titan ?a thousand apologies?.Multiple studies (pdf) have drawn causal links between the growth of palm oil plantations in south-east Asia and deforestation but the court ruled that Delhaize?s claims were unverifiable.Ferrero has a robust palm oil charter and says it can trace almost all of its palm oil to sustainable sources. The company came top of a WWF sustainability league table of 137 palm oil buyers last year. It is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Palm Oil Innovation Group.?The court sustained Ferrero?s arguments that it is illegal to claim that a product without palm oil is de facto better for environment and has better nutritional qualities than one containing palm oil,? a spokesman for Ferrero said.?Ferrero has taken admirable steps to reduce the impact of palm oil within its supply chain,? said Glenn Hurowitz, the CEO of Mighty, which campaigns against deforestation caused by palm oil. ?But it is as yet impossible to delink one company?s supplies from the broader, continued deforestation of the palm oil industry as a whole.?A separate argument by Ferrero that Delhaize not be allowed to call their spread ?Choco? ? because it contains no chocolate ? was thrown out by the court.For its part, Delhaize said Choco was still being manufactured with sunflower oil, cocoa butter and coconut oil ? and packaged as palm oil-free.?We have not seen any impact on [Choco] sales. On the contrary,? said the firm?s communications director Roel Dekelver. ?Despite this judgement, we will continue to propose and present innovative and inspirational products to customers that answer their different needs. This won?t hold us back.? The Belgian supermarket, which merged with Ahold to create a ?40bn retail empire last year, had also alleged health benefits from palm-oil free produce, citing ?potential health concerns? from palm oil in an assessment by the European Food Safety Authority.However, this assessment also applied to other vegetable oils and products, and the analysis is currently being reassessed. Ian Barber, the communications director of the Advertising Association, said that the first rule of advertising was: ?If you can?t back up the claim, you can?t make it?. ?I?d imagine the strategy open to Delhaize now is just to advertise that they?re palm oil-free and leave world to make up its mind if that?s a good or a bad thing,? he said.

The NDA government has started issuing Haj applications from January 2 and also launched the Haj Committee of India mobile application to help pilgrims apply online.","Summarise: Saudi Arabia has increased India's annual Haj quota from 1.36 lakh to 1.70 lakh, biggest such expansion in last 29 years, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said today. An agreement to this regard was inked by Minister of State for Minority Affairs (Independent Charge) Naqvi with Saudi Arabias Haj and Umrah Minister Dr Mohammad Saleh bin Taher Benten at Jeddah today, making the expansion effective from the current year. The Saudi authorities had five years ago slashed quotas for foreign pilgrims coming from each country by 20 per cent in view of safety of the devotees as they undertook expansion of Grand Mosque there. Accordingly, India's quota was brought down to 1.36 lakh from nearly 1.70 lakh in 2012. Expressing pleasure at signing of the agreement, Naqvi said his meeting with Benten was ""very fruitful"" as constructive discussion was held on the whole gamut of issues related to the pilgrimage, transport and accommodation facilities for pilgrims and their safety. ""On behalf of the people and Government of India, we also extend gratitude to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Excellency Saudi Arabia King Salman bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, for his keen personal interest and initiative in organising a successful Haj 2016,"" Naqvi said in a statement. SAUDI ARABIAN LEADERSHIP Naqvi exuded confidence that under the visionary leadership of Saudi Arabias King Salman bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, the ""excellent"" relationship between India and Saudi Arabia will be further strengthened. Stating India and Saudi Arabia share ideals of global peace, progress and prosperity, Naqvi said the two countries are tied together with strong civilisational, cultural, economic and political links. ""The regular visits by the leaders and senior-level officials of the two nations have further strengthened the relationship between the two nations. The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Saudi Arabia during April last year added new dimensions to our vibrant relationship,"" he said. The Minister also expressed satisfaction over the improvements in services offered to pilgrims which indicates Saudi Arabias firm commitment towards welfare and betterment of pilgrims. The NDA government has started issuing Haj applications from January 2. The last date for submission of applications is January 24.

The BJP will look to continue its winning momentum, having resoundingly won Uttar Pradesh in the recent Assembly elections as well as a number of civic bodies in Maharashtra and Odisha. For Congress, the MCD election could be a chance to save face after embarrassing defeats across the country.

"During an interview, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson revealed that he did not want the position and he only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it. Adding that he had not met President Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower, Tillerson said, ""When he asked me...to be Secretary of State, I was stunned.""","Summarise: Rex Tillerson has said he did not want to be US secretary of state and only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it.The former ExxonMobil oil executive revealed his initial reluctance in an interview published after a controversial trip to Asia and hours before the biggest event of his two months at the state department, an international meeting on Wednesday about how to fight Islamic State (Isis).  ?I didn?t want this job. I didn?t seek this job,? Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR), in an interview conducted on his official plane during the three-nation Asia trip. ?My wife told me I?m supposed to do this.?He said he had not met Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower after the surprise election victory, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect ?about the world? and his experiences as an oil company CEO.?When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,? he said, adding that at 65 years old, at the end of a four-decade career at ExxonMobil, he had expected to retire: ?I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.?However, he said that when he returned to his Texas home after meeting Trump in New York, his wife, Renda St Clair, shook her finger in his face and said: ?I told you God?s not through with you.?He said he now feels his wife had been right: ?I?m supposed to do this.?Not everyone shares that view. Tillerson has been the subject of heavy criticism since taking the post as the country?s top diplomat at the beginning of February. He was left out of the loop of several critical foreign policy decisions made in the administration?s early days, most importantly the travel ban for refugees and visitors from a list of Muslim countries.He has also almost totally dodged the press for the first few weeks in his job. He did not take the Washington diplomatic press corps with him on his Asia tour, breaking with decades-old practice. The sole exception was the journalist from the IJR, a little-known outlet founded by a former Republican operative. The initial explanation from the state department was that he wanted to save money and take a smaller plane than usual. In his interview, Tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver.He told the IJR: ?I?m not a big media press access person. I personally don?t need it. I understand it?s important to get the message of what we?re doing out, but I also think there?s only a purpose in getting the message out when there?s something to be done.?When questioned about Russia, the IJR reported: ?He was so cagey ? his answer wasn?t even worthy of inclusion.?Tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third. Senior Republicans have said the cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid proposed by the White House would not pass Congress. In his remarks to the IJR, however, Tillerson appeared to relish the management challenge of cutting down the size of the US diplomatic establishment.?Looking at ongoing conflicts, if we accept that we?re just going to continue to never solve any of these conflicts, then the budget should stay at the current level,? he said. He said he had not yet talked to Trump about what a pared-down state department would look like or how it will be staffed: ?We haven?t gotten that far yet.?While in South Korea, Tillerson was reported in the Seoul press to have snubbed the government by telling Korean officials he was too tired to dine with them. In response, he accused his hosts of being deliberately misleading. ?They never invited us for dinner, then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn?t playing very well in public for them, so they put out a statement that we didn?t have dinner because I was tired,? he told the IJR. On Tuesday, the state department was fighting off a new controversy, after it emerged Tillerson would skip what would have been his first Nato foreign ministers? meeting in early April in Brussels so he could be in Florida for Trump?s first meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The state department spokesman, Mark Toner, insisted the administration was 100% committed to Nato and that Tillerson would be meeting many member foreign ministers at the anti-Isis meeting in Washington on Wednesday. Toner said the state department had proposed new dates for a possible Nato meeting."

Earlier this month, a passenger was caught by the customs officials at Delhi airport for allegedly carrying gold foils pasted on a carton. Gold weighing 700 gm worth up to Rs18.5 lakh was recovered. According to the official, smugglers are trying every trick to smuggle gold to Delhi as the customs department has increased vigil. ?We have come across cases in which gold was stitched into a brassiere, stuffed in the rod of baby walker, and tied on thigh guards and waist,? he said.Customs had seized 6.6 kg gold from the Delhi airport in 2012-13, which increased to 384 kg in 2013-14. During 2014-15, the officials seized 574 kg gold and in 2016, over 220 kg gold worth ?60 crore was confiscated."

"Unidentified dead bodies are spotted floating almost daily in the Tigris river near the recently ISIS-liberated Iraqi city of Mosul, according to reports. The bodies are the evidence of extrajudicial executions of ISIS militants by the Iraqi security forces, non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has alleged. Soldiers have shifted the corpses to a morgue at the city's general hospital.","Summarise: The bodies washed up with grim regularity on the banks of the Tigris downstream from Mosul, a daily reminder of the vicious fight against Islamic State that played out a few dozen miles away.All were heavily decomposed, most bound and blindfolded, some mutilated. The corpses began arriving last spring, but as the mission to oust Isis fighters from the once-thriving city intensified, so too did the number of dead floating towards the west bank town of Qayyarah.?I see dead bodies in the water daily,? said Ahmed Mohammed, a driver, speaking earlier this year. ?The number has increased since early April. There were five bodies floating in the river recently in one single day. They are young men with their hands tied behind their back and are blindfolded.?Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi this week declared victory after nearly nine months of fierce fighting to displace the extremist group from the city where it proclaimed its ?caliphate? in 2014. But as Mosul lies in ruins ? and the last women and children emerge from the rubble ? a bloody picture of the campaign?s impact is emerging. Local people who spotted corpses midstream would try to catch them and then call the army, Mohammed said. Soldiers then take them to a makeshift morgue at the city?s general hospital, run by Mansour Maroof Mansour. Most of the dead found in the river with some identifiable features intact were young men who appeared to be in their late 20s, said Mansour, but he has learned little else about who they were. ?We can?t identify the bodies in the river. They are very decomposed and there is nothing on them to use for identification,? he said, standing in a room filled with dozens of bodybags. None had been claimed, and even that toll of the unknown dead is not exhaustive; some bodies are lost.?(Once) the body of a boy also floated by but we could not catch it as it was too small and went through the gaps in the barrier,? said the driver Mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.Human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around Mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the Tigris river. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said evidence points to government forces, killing suspected Isis members or collaborators without trial or due process.Warning of the killings in April, Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director for HRW said: ?The bodies of bound and blindfolded men are being found one after the other in and around Mosul and in the Tigris river, raising serious concerns about extrajudicial killings by government forces. The lack of any apparent government action to investigate these deaths undermines the government?s statements on protecting detainee rights.?Little has been done to investigate the killings, however. ?The horrors that the people of Mosul have witnessed and the disregard for human life by all parties to this conflict must not go unpunished,? Lynn Maalouf, research director for Amnesty International in the Middle East, said. The violence upstream casts a long shadow in Qayyarah, which was freed from Isis rule at the start of the nine-month Mosul campaign. Most residents are reluctant even to talk about the bodies in the river. ?I don?t know anything about that subject,? said one fishmonger in the newly re-opened market, buzzing with soldiers and militia fighters.Isis exploited Iraq?s sectarian tensions to facilitate its rise to power. Many Sunnis who felt disenfranchised by the Shia majority government or feared becoming targets of security forces welcomed or at least tolerated the group?s arrival in 2014. As the extremism and violence of Isis world view became clearer, many Sunnis left or privately turned against the group, but suspicions of collaboration linger and in some Sunni areas a sense of apprehension remains.?Blood for blood,? reads graffiti on a wall of a house in Qayyarah that locals say belonged to Ali Khether, a well-known Isis commander who had lived in the town. He is described by one as ?The child of adultery, Ali Khether, the Daeshi? ? a name that refers to Daesh, a pejorative name for Isis.Close by stands the town?s small stadium where Isis, with the aid of local people, killed dozens, with the most cursory of trials, on charges ranging from spying for the security services to homosexualityNow as Isis retreats to the Syrian city of Raqqa and desert areas of western Iraq, those who were on the receiving end of their brutality for over two years have set up their own militia groups. Loosely attached to the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), they are taking the law into their own hands.?PMU militias have carried out a systematic pattern of violations, including enforced disappearance, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings and torture of Sunni Arab men and boys, seemingly in revenge for IS attacks,? said Amnesty International in a report earlier this year.Security forces who retook the town found the bodies of many Isis victims that had been dumped in the river, said Walid Khaled an officer at Qayyarah police station, but he had no idea who the more recent waves of dead might be. ?We don?t know where they come from, they are unidentified,? he said.Some in the town say the bodies are more Isis victims killed by the last fighters holed up in Mosul, but the Iraqi security forces had blocked the river around 20km outside the city with a floating boom designed to stop fighters sneaking out or reinforcements getting in by water. Territory further down river towards Qayyarah has been in the control of Iraqi security forces for months.A soldier guarding a floating bridge connecting Munirah village, around 20km south of Mosul on the western bank, refused to give his name, but appeared to confirm that extrajudicial killings were taking place beside the river.He showed the Guardian a video of himself and other soldiers, dragging a limp body with a bloody face along the edge of the water. ?He was Daesh hiding in the reeds and we killed him,? the soldier said with satisfaction."

"Martin Sorrell, CEO of world's largest advertising and public relations company WPP, was awarded a payout of over $62 million (?400 crore) in 2016. The payout was around 32% less from the $91 million (?585 crore) he received in 2015, one of the biggest in UK's corporate history. With this, Sorrell has received $272 million in total remuneration since 2012.","Summarise: Sir Martin Sorrell received Â£48m in remuneration last year as WPP, the marketing and advertising company he founded and runs, moved to curb the level of his future payouts to avoid further clashes with investors.Sorrell, who has been on the receiving end of a string of shareholder voting revolts at WPP?s annual meetings in recent years, received total pay, bonuses and incentive scheme payouts of Â£48.1m in 2016.The figure is 31.6% lower than the Â£70.4m he received in 2015, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, which was opposed by one-third of WPP shareholders at last year?s AGM. The payout, the last to be awarded under WPP?s controversial ?Leap? scheme, means Sorrell has received about Â£210m in total remuneration since 2012.WPP has introduced a less generous arrangement for Sorrell, which is expected to pay out Â£19m a year. It will be the subject of a binding vote at the company?s annual meeting in June.However, WPP said on Friday that it intended to tighten the policy further with a potential payout band of Â£14.9m to Â£19.2m maximum this year. From 2018, that will fall to between Â£18m and Â£13m as dividend equivalent payments are scrapped.The company has moved to stem further potential run-ins with investors at a time of renewed scrutiny of corporate Britain since the Brexit vote and the warning from Theresa May that she would curb boardroom excess. WPP?s chairman, Robert Quarta, appointed at last year?s annual meeting, also said planning to identify the successor to Sorrell, 72, had intensified.?Our succession planning process, which has always been rigorous, has become even more focused and detailed over the past year,? said Quarta, in WPP?s annual report published on Friday. ?Whether it happens in the near or distant future, when Sir Martin leaves his role as chief executive, we will have an exceptional team of potential candidates on the bench.?Sorrell shows no signs of slowing down, having celebrated the birth of another child on the day of the US presidential election last year. He has no plans to step aside and said, on the question of succession, that there is ?nothing to see here?. His pay has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012, during what became known as the shareholder spring, nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual package for the previous year. Last year, Sorrell defended his remuneration, arguing that he had put three decades of his life into turning WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a global marketing business worth Â£22bn.?I?m not a Johnny-come-lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],? he said. ?If it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years ? I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.?The question of a successor has exercised investors in recent years, with Guy Jubb, the former head of governance at Standard Life Investments, using his final appearance at a WPP annual meeting in 2015 to criticise the apparent ?Sorrellcentricity? at the company.Quarta, writing in the annual report, said there is a list of internal and external candidates who could take over.?As part of our continuous assessment of those individuals who might one day become chief executive of the group, we have invited a number of leaders within WPP companies to present to the board and attend board meetings,? he said. ?This exercise gives me greater confidence than ever in the strength of our people and their potential to succeed at the very top.?This internal pool is, of course, maintained alongside a constantly refined list of external candidates.?Quarta said internal candidates include those who report directly to Sorrell, as well as ?many who currently occupy the senior tier below?."

""The film made me angry. I saw the film and realised we really live in a world where as women we are not allowed to do or say anything. Here was this entertaining movie that spoke about what I think. Why didnt I think of it? I loved it,"" Ekta, 42, told PTI in an interview. She came onboard the project when it had already hit a roadblock. Jha called her to watch the film and asked whether she would like to distribute and she immediately agreed. ""I decided to distribute this movie knowing that I might not earn profits. Then I was hoping we would get a certificate and thats when it landed into a soup with the censor board.""

After the film was cleared for release, Ektas team came up with an edgy poster of the film, which depicts a woman showing her middle finger. ""I thought, will this be an artie movie that 200 people will watch or a film where Ill get more and more women to see it?

A lot of women say they wear lipstick when they want to feel good. I read somewhere there is nothing that a right shade of lipstick cant fix. So many acts by us are a form of rebellion.""

"Krishna Chinthapalli, an Indian-origin doctor in London, had warned against the type of ransomware attack which hit 99 countries on Friday. He had published an article just two days before the attack about the vulnerability of Britain's National Health Service to ransomware. ""We should be prepared: more hospitals will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year,"" he wrote.","Summarise: (Eds: Updating with additional inputs) From Aditi Khanna London, May 13 (PTI) An Indian-origin doctor based in London had warned against the cyber-hack of the UKs state-run National Health Service just days before it crippled the countrys network. Krishna Chinthapalli, a neurology registrar atÂ the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, had said an increasing number of hospitals could be shut down by ransomeware attacks inÂ an article on the vulnerability of the NHS network in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday, two days before the major cyber hack of the National Health Service (NHS) system on Friday. He had highlighted an incident at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge where a nurse clicked on a malicious link and malware infected her computer and started to encrypt sensitive files. ""Fortunately, the hospitals daily data backup had just been completed. The IT director admitted that they were very lucky, saying, Timing absolutely was everything for us,"" Chinthapalli wrote. ""We should be prepared: more hospitals will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year,"" he wrote. The revelation came as UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed today that as many as 48 NHS trusts had been affected by theÂ large-scale cyber-hack by an international criminal gang wreaked havoc around the country. After chairing an emergency meeting of the COBRA committee, Rudd said that all but 6 trusts were now back to normal. Confirming that 97 per cent of hospitals were ""back to normal"", she said,Â ""This is a virus that attacked Windows platforms. The fact is the NHS has fallen victim to this."" The Opposition Liberal Democrat and Labour parties have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack. Patients of the state-funded country-wide service are still facing days of chaos as appointments and surgeries were cancelled after NHS organisations from London to Scotland were hit in the ""ransomware"" attack yesterday. NHS Digital said the impact of the cyberattack could continue. ""The situation is changing and impacting organisations in a range of different ways,"" a spokesperson said. Ciaran Martin, who leads the UKs National Cyber Security Centre, said his team was doing everything in their power to get ""vital services"" back up and running. ""We are very aware that attacks on critical services such as the NHS have a massive impact on individuals and their families, and we are doing everything in our power to help them restore these vital services,"" he said. ""Its important to understand that cyber attacks can be different from other forms of crime in that their sometimes highly technical and anonymous nature means it can take some time to understand how it worked, who was behind it and what the impact is,"" he told the BBC. Critically ill patients are being diverted to unaffected hospitals as computer systems failed in A&E units and doctors were locked out of test results, X-rays and patient records. NHS England said patients needing emergency treatment should go to Accidents & Emergency (A&E) or access emergency services as they normally would. However, there have been some reports of ambulances being diverted from affected hospitals and individual NHS trusts have asked registered patients not to attend unless it is urgent. Londons Barts Health NHS Trust, the largest trust in the UK, cancelled all outpatient appointments at its five hospitals today. The NHS has not been affected in Wales and Northern Ireland. The assault is part of an attack that has affected organisations in more than 70 countries, including the United States, China, Russia and Spain, disrupting power and telephone companies. Gangs are thought to have used tools stolen from US spies and dumped online by hackers linked to Russia. ""This is not targeted at the NHS, its an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said. ""The National Cyber Security Centre is working closely with NHS Digital to ensure they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety. We are not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised,"" she said. The attack came after warnings of NHS vulnerability, with cybersecurity allegedly neglected despite a series of attempted hacks. Ransomware programmes, which are sent by email and spread swiftly, can be bought on the dark web with sellers negotiating a percentage of the takings. ""We will be advising NHS trusts to modernise their platforms,"" UK home secretary Amber Rudd said. The malware used in the NHS attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems. It encrypts files on a users computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again. The demand is for a payment of 300 dollars in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files. "

"According to reports, 2.5 lakh tourists visited Kashmir Valley during the first quarter of this year while 3.5 lakh tourists visited the Valley during the same period in 2016. Eleven lakh tourists visited Kashmir Valley between January-July 2016. Following the death of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, the number fell to one lakh for the remainder of 2016. ","Summarise: There is finally good news coming in from Kashmir in the form of tourists visiting the Valley. According to the MHA sources, two-and-a-half lakh tourists visited the ""paradise on earth"" in the first quarter of this year. The figure is much lesser than that of the same period of 2016, which witnessed 3-and-a-half lakh tourists visiting the Valley. The Valley saw a massive slump in tourist arrival since the death of Hizbul Mujahideen Commander Burhan Wani in July last year. The year 2016 sawÂ  an impressive 11 lakh tourists heading to the Valley for vacations till July before Wani's death. But the number came down to just one lakh in the next five months.

Police have arrested five men for stealing nearly ?3.8 crore-worth iPhones from a moving delivery truck in the Netherlands. The men drove close to the back of the truck and one of the suspects climbed onto it to break in through the doors while it was being driven. He then passed the iPhones from the truck to other suspects.,"Summarise: Dutch police have arrested five men suspected of stealing ?500,000 (Â£448,000) of iPhones in a dangerous late-night heist from a moving truck akin to action scenes from Fast and Furious.Dutch police said that the five men, aged from 33 to 43 and all from Romania, allegedly raided a delivery truck full of iPhones on the A73 highway near Horst on the night of 24 July. Using a modified van, they drove close enough to the back of the truck to allow one of the suspects to climb onto it and break in through the doors while it was being driven down the road.The suspect then passed boxes of Apple?s iPhone from the delivery truck into the modified van through a hole in its roof.Dutch police spokesman Ed Kraszewski said that officers had long been investigating thefts from trucks but had remained sceptical that such a heist could be pulled off. Not any more.Kraszewski said: ?The truck was taking its freight from A to B and did not stop. Even so, [the phones] were gone. So it must have happened that way. And now we finally have the evidence, with the van and the loot.?The five men were arrested at a holiday park in the central Netherlands on Saturday. Police recovered the iPhones and the van they believe was used in the heist. The suspects are to appear Tuesday before an investigating judge.Kraszewski said similar raids had been reported elsewhere in Europe, almost always targeting high-end smartphones, but that there had been no arrests until now. The thieves are accused of being responsible for emptying 17 trucks of expensive goods since 2015, according to local reports.Romanian police released a video, shot from a police helicopter of a similar raid from 2012, where thieves drove up behind a truck using an angle grinder to break open the doors and steal goods while other members of the gang held-back traffic in other cars.Dutch police will send the fingerprints of the suspects to colleagues around Europe to check for potential matches to previous crimes."
"The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is planning to conduct the class 10 and class 12 Board exams on the same dates, in different shifts. According to the plan, class 12 exams will be held in the morning and class 10 in the afternoon. This would reduce duration of exams and give teachers extra time for checking the papers.","Summarise: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) proposes to hold the finals for classes 10 and 12 on same dates in two shifts, a move that will reduce the examination period and give teachers extra time to check answer-scripts more thoroughly.The new plan was designed after the board met principals of some of the top schools in New Delhi and its satellite cities. The CBSE, which has two panels committees to suggest ways to improve the system, will review the suggestions before a final decision is taken.The country?s largest school board that has more than 18,000 institutions affiliated to it holds the two exams usually from March 1, barring exceptions such as this year?s state assembly elections that delayed the test by more than a week. The exams run close to 45 days because of an array of subjects and separate time-tables for the two classes.The plan to set common dates for both exams, with Class 12 in the morning and Class 10 in the afternoon, is likely to decrease the overall duration of the finals.At present, exams are not held in the afternoon.The reduced number of exam days will give evaluators ? a pool of schoolteachers selected by the CBSE ? more time to check the answer-scripts of students before the results are declared in May.The teachers usually get a small window to check the answers, given the sheer size of the number of examinees. More than a million students wrote the Class 12 exam this year. ?By conducting Class 12 and 10 exams on the same day we can reduce the examination period and provide more time to the evaluators,? a senior board official said.The CBSE has drawn criticism for its evaluation system as several students complained of variation in marks after asking the board for a relook.The board said it took extra care to cut faults, but the possibility of human error cannot be ruled out in calculating the marks, putting them on answer-scripts and feeding them manually in computers.?Efforts are made to further improve the system,? the official said. The meeting with principals was called to gather views ?before deciding anything on the evaluation and examination system?, the official said.According to sources, most principals were against reevaluation or rechecking of answer-scripts, but won?t mind verification of marks.?A longer evaluation period will be better for students. This will give teachers more time to look at the answer sheets, maybe more teachers can look at them. This will ensure fewer errors,? a principal said.Another principal said ?we have assured the board we will send our best teachers? to check answers.It has also been suggested that the board should ask students to suggest teachers who could be good evaluators. Another suggestion is to increase the remuneration of evaluators, at least by 20%, and to set a figure as to how many copies they need to check.?We are looking at restricting the number of copies that can be evaluated by a person in six hours so that quality is maintained,? the CBSE official said.(Inputs from A Mariyam Alavi in New Delhi)"

The village is not far from the border with Maharashtra.The baby is admitted to a hospital and will be handed over to the district child welfare committee (CWC), officials said.Despite stringent rape laws, people in rural areas rarely report sexual assaults to police because of the stigma attached.

"Just 100 companies have been the source of 71% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a Carbon Majors report. The report further claims that half of the emissions were traced to 25 state-owned fossil fuel producers. If the current fossil fuel extraction trend continues, global average temperatures would rise by 4ÂºC by 2100, the report warns.","Summarise: Just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world?s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a new report.The Carbon Majors Report (pdf) ?pinpoints how a relatively small set of fossil fuel producers may hold the key to systemic change on carbon emissions,? says Pedro Faria, technical director at environmental non-profit CDP, which published the report in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute. Traditionally, large scale greenhouse gas emissions data is collected at a national level but this report focuses on fossil fuel producers. Compiled from a database of publicly available emissions figures, it is intended as the first in a series of publications to highlight the role companies and their investors could play in tackling climate change. The report found that more than half of global industrial emissions since 1988 ? the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established ? can be traced to just 25 corporate and state-owned entities. The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change, according to the report. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have catastrophic consequences including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.While companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says Faria, the barrier is the ?absolute tension? between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.A Carbon Tracker study in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $2tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables ? in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.CDP says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. A fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. ?That puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with carbon majors and urge them to disclose climate risk,? says Faria.Investors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. ?Not only is it morally risky, it?s economically risky. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. Those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.?There is a ?growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,? says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the RE100 initiative. Volvo recently announced that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019. And oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. Shell set up a renewables arm in 2015 with a $1.7bn investment attached and a spokesperson for Chevron says it?s ?committed to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions? and is investing in two of the world?s largest carbon dioxide injection projects to capture and store carbon. A BP spokesperson says its ?determined to be part of the solution? for climate change and is ?investing in renewables and low-carbon innovation.? And ExxonMobil, which has faced heavy criticism for its environmental record, has been exploring carbon capture and storage.But for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a ?nasty, brutish and short? end within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models. Investors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. ?The future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops??"

They reached the destination a night before the competition, while their luggage, which contained their medical books, came later.","Summarise: Stranded at the airport for nearly 24 hours and without their luggage for a good part of the competition, Indian women boxers had to deal with more than just opponents at the Nation's Cup in Serbia but showed tremendous fortitude to return with half a dozen medals.The 10-member team returned to the country early Tuesday morning after finishing third in the competition behind powerhouses Kazakhstan and Russia.Haryana-girl Neeraj (51kg), competing in her maiden international tournament, stood out with a gold medal, while Sarjubala Devi (48kg), Priyanka Chaudhary (60kg), Pooja (69kg) and Seema Punia settled for silver medals. Veteran Kavita Goyat (75kg) was the lone bronze-medallist.The girls reached Vrbas, where the event was staged, a night before the competition started. This was after a gruelling journey that was stretched by close to 24 hours due to cancellation of flights following snowstorms across Europe.""All Turkish Airlines flights had been cancelled and we were stuck at the airport which resembled a madhouse with so many people stranded from all over the world,"" chief coach Gurbax Sandhu, who has been made in charge of women after more than two decades as men's coach, said.""The federation got us on another flight as quickly as they could.

They were marvellous in the way they handled the situation. Not one girl complained, they managed things in their own little ways but did not let the situation affect their performance.

"Former PM Manmohan Singh, in a letter dated 2015, had termed the bull-taming sport Jallikattu a ""cruel form of entertainment"", while the Congress party has supported the protests against its ban in 2017. Adding that traditional Jallikattu must be allowed, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has said that it is much better than bullfighting in Spain where the Bull is killed.","Summarise: The Congress party may have opposed jalikattu with its full force but today it stands a divided house. Even as party chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala walks a cautious line there are leaders like Digvijaya Singh who outrightly support it. But what puts Congress in a spot is a letter accessed exclusively by India Today written by former PrimeÂ  Minister Manmohan Singh while in opposition expressing strong disapproval for this age old Tamil tradition that has become the focus of the country's polity now.The letter is dated December 15, 2015 when the Congress was in opposition and Dr Singh seized to be the Prime Minister. This letter was written in the capacity of a Rajya Sabha MP to NG Jayasimha,the Managing Director of Humane Society International (India). Humane Society argued strongly against Jalikattu like many other organisations like People for Ethical Treatment to Animal or PETA that is at the receiving end of people's ire in Tamil Nadu today. In the said letter Dr Manmohan Singh remarked, ""The Human Society International/India affiliate has a worthy objective and certainly we have to discourage bullfights which provide a cruel form of entertainment"". Dr Singh didn't stop there but went on to ""wish you all success in achieving your objective"" of getting bull fight which is popularly known as jalikattu banned.This letter is in sync with the views expressed by many ministers in the UPA regime like Jairam Ramesh. But come today the scenario is absolutely different. A popular uprising along the Marina Beach of Chennai in demand of the sport that Tamils call an inherent part of their culture has forced many political parties to modulate their views. Congress' Chief SpokesmanÂ  Randeep Surjewala in a tweet put the onus on the centre and taking a neutral view much away from Manmohan Singh's militant opinion on jalikattu said, ""Congress respects people of Tamil Nadu in preserving the culture & tradition of Jallikattu more so as adequate safety precautions is taken. People have a legitimate right to protect their pride & conserve their culture. Govt's duty to strike a balance & respect the sentiments."" Something that wasÂ  'cruel entertainment' in 2015 turned into a 'legitimate right' in January 2017 for Congress, thanks to the popular mood.Well that is not all. Even as Surjewala tries to undo the damage, its another Spokesperson and a senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi doubles up as the counsel for the petitioners calling for a ban on the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu. According to him, Jallikattu is not a sport, it is a ""brutal and wanton"" torture of an animal and that since holding Jallikattu is not permissible under law after the Supreme Court order, even supporting or encouraging it is defiance of the Supreme Court order. So as jalikattu debate rages on, the Congress is a divided house with no single school of thought. It's general secretary supports it, it's media chief maintains a neutral view as another leader fights for the ones it's own party is not ready to openly back. And amid all these the letter bomb is surely going to put the grand old party in an even more uncomfortable spot. "

The film's producer Mukesh Bhatt said he requested the censor board of Pakistan to at least view the film and take a decision but has not heard from them.","Summarise: Vidya Balan starrer Begum Jaan, written and directed by National award-winning filmmaker Srijit Mukherji, has been banned in Pakistan.

Speaking exclusively to India Today TV, Mahesh Bhatt explained that Pakistan does not screen films which revolve around the partition era. ""I was told by my distributor that Pakistan has a policy does not permit the import of films which deal with the issue of partition. On learning this I requested the key officer of the censor board of Pakistan to at least view the film and then take a decision. I was assured that they would look into the matter. Sadly, I have not heard from them after that,"" he said.Bhatt also added, ""Later my distributor informed me that his office has been intimated that Begum Jaan should not be imported by him into Pakistan.""Co-starring Naseeruddin Shah, Chunky Pandey, Ila Arun, Gauahar Khan in key roles, Begum Jaan, the Hindi remake of the critically acclaimed Bengali film Rajkahini (2015) is all set to hit theatres on April 14.

The Pakistan censor board reportedly asked the film's makers for two cuts, the scene where the Indian national anthem was played and portions showing the Indian national flag. Producer Aamir Khan refused to abide by the two cuts and chose not to release the film in the neighboring country.More recently, Tapsee Pannu's Naam Shabana didn't see the light of day in Pakistan, due to 'terrorism-related scenes,' and Jolly LLB 2 too irked the Pakistan authorities since it had discussions around the Kashmir issue. Films including Neerja, Tere Bin Laden amoung others too haven't been released, since they reportedly shows Pakistan in poor light."

"The Allahabad High Court on Monday granted bail to two accused in the 2015 lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri for allegedly slaughtering a cow. A local BJP leader, who is the father of one of the accused who got bail, praised the BJP for providing justice to his son. Notably, 14 people have been granted bail in the case.  ","Summarise: Vishal Rana (21) and Hari Om (26), accused in the 2015 lynching of Mohammad Ikhlaq in Bisada for allegedly slaughtering a cow, was granted bail by the Allahabad high court on Monday.Vishal?s father Sanjay Rana (47), a local BJP leader, said his son ?got justice? because Uttar Pradesh ?has a BJP government?.?Though government has no say in court?s decision, it ensured justice is done,? he said, and claimed that in the previous regime, officials were did not ensure fair investigation.Sanjay also claimed that ?the whole village, including Muslims, were happy over the bail of my son?.?I do not have any grouse against my Muslim brothers. I am annoyed over Ikhlaq?s family, who slaughtered a cow and later made my family victim for it. It was a mob that attacked the family and I have suffered for it,? he claimed.The case pertains to the September 28, 2015 lynching of 55-year-old Ikhlaq and the assault on his family in Bisada village near Noida by a mob on the allegation of slaughtering a cow and storing its meat for consumption. Following the incident, 18 people were taken into custody, of which 14 had gotten bail.

The duo, who got bail, would be released after two days due to legal formalities.The case had political repercussions as BJP leaders ? in opposition to then-CM Akhilesh?s Samajwadi Party, which was seen to be favouring Muslims ? wooed voters in from the region on the plank of getting the accused released from jail during the UP assembly elections earlier this year.Union home minister Rajnath Singh, too, had addressed a gathering in the village.Vishal?s advocate Ram Sharan Nagar said the court of Justice SK Gupta granted bail to his client on Monday.

"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday announced a loan waiver for an additional 10 lakh farmers who had been left out of last month's waiver, which amounted to over ?34,000 crore. This will reportedly add a ?8,000-crore burden on the state. Fadnavis further criticised the Opposition for alleged anomalies in the 2008-2009 loan waiver package. ","Summarise: Widening the scope of the farm loan waiver, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said that the package would benefit about 10 lakh more farmers whose loans banks had restructured. Now, the loans of up to 46 lakh farmers will be waived. This will also put an additional burden of up to Rs8,000 crore on the exchequer.After days of protests last month, the government announced a loan waiver of Rs34,022 crore. A major chunk of the farmers whose outstanding loans were restructured in 2014-15 and 2015-16 owing to drought were left out. However, they were eligible for Rs15,000 and Rs25,000 in incentives because they paid their loans regularly. ?The outstanding amount of the farmers who got their loans restructured in 2014-15 and 2015-16 is Rs3,500 crore and Rs5,200 crore,? said an official from the cooperation department.In a reply to both the houses of the state legislature, Fadnavis said that the government would ensure that the package was not misused by ineligible people. He also refused to concede to the opposition?s demand to extend the cut off date to June 30, 2017 from June 30, 2016. He argued that this would set a bad precedent and was against the norms of the Reserve Bank of India. Fadnavis also attacked the opposition for alleged anomalies in the 2008-09 loan waiver package. He said at the time farmers in five-suicide prone districts in Vidarbha were given Rs286 crore, while farmers in Mumbai got Rs208 crore. ?There were beneficiaries from Mumbai who were not even farmers. They used this amount for commercial and construction works. A major chunk of waiver went to ghost accounts. Some of the banks even had revived their dormant accounts to reap the benefits. To avoid a repeat, we have asked farmers to fill up forms,? he said.The chief minister said that the government would scrutinise the list of more than 600 people from Mumbai, who had applied for the loan waiver. He also ridiculed the Congress and the NCP for their claim that the loan waiver was the result of their Sangharsh Yatra in April and May. He said that the protest march was a dud. In the legislative council too, Fadnavis said the erstwhile Congress-NCP government took?12 months and 15 months to disburse loan packages in 2008 and 2009 . ?The forms will be collected in a month. In August, we will scrutinise them and in September we will complete the first lot of the loan waiver,? he said. "
"State Bank of India, which is going to merge with its five associate banks, has decided to shut down 47% of these banks' offices, including the head offices of three of them. This process will start from April 24. Notably, the five associate banks will cease to exist as legal entities and become a part of SBI from April 1.","Summarise: State Bank of India (SBI), which will see five associate banks merge into it on April 1, has decided to shut down almost half the offices of these banks, including the head offices of three of them. This process will start from April 24.""Out of the five head offices of the associate banks, we will retain only two. Three head offices of the associate banks will be unbound along with 27 zonal offices, 81 regional offices and 11 network offices of the associate banks,"" SBI Managing Director Dinesh Kumar Khara told IANS in an interview.""We will keep their structure in place till April 24 and, post that, we will start dismantling the associate banks' controlling offices, which includes head offices, regional offices, zonal offices and network offices,"" Khara said.LIST OF ASSOCIATE BANKSThe five associate banks that will merge with SBI are: SBBJ (State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur), SBM (State Bank of Mysore), SBT (State Bank of Travancore), SBP (State Bank of Patiala) and SBH (State Bank of Hyderabad).SBI is India's largest bank with assets of Rs 30.72 lakh crore and figures at No. 64 in the global ranking of banks (as of December 2015; December 2016 ranking is still awaited). Post-merger, with assets of approximately Rs 40 lakh crore, it will be among the top 50 banks in the world. SBI Chief Economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh told IANS that, post-merger, the bank will be at No. 45.The shut-down move is to avoid overlapping offices in the same area and ""we intend to remove any kind of duplicacy in the controlling structure"", Khara said.The five associate banks will cease to exist as legal entities and become a part of SBI from April 1, but the various merger processes will start only after April 24, once the balance sheets of the five entities are audited and added.MANAGING DIRECTOR's VIEW""We will have to get the balance sheets of the associate banks audited a day prior to the merger, that is, on March 31. The balance sheets of the banks will be drawn up and added; it takes 15-20 days. Soon after the audit is done, the branches will be completely merged with SBI,"" Khara told IANS.There are currently 550 SBI offices while its associate banks have 259. The target for the number of controlling offices after the merger is 687 -- a reduction of 122 offices.Employees directly affected by these shutdowns -- estimated at 1,107 -- will be redeployed, mostly in customer-interface operations, Khara said.""The net result is that people in controlling functions will be available for deployment on the ground for improving reach to the consumer,"" he said.""There are about 5-7 people in every regional office and 20-odd people in each zonal office. One regional office controls 30-40 branches, while 4-5 regional offices are controlled by one zonal office,"" he told IANS.The associate banks have also offered a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to employees who do not wish to relocate. ""VRS is only an option, else they will be relocated. They will have a different role,"" he said.OTHER MERGER PROCESSES TO SOON COME INTO EFFECT TOOAlong with the winding-up of these offices, a number of merger processes will come into effect simultaneously, including the data merger of the five entities.""Data merger will also start from April 24 and we will finish it by May end. That is the plan of action,"" he said, adding that the bank had given itself six months to complete all merger-related processes.""I would rather say that within a quarter all the things should be in order. Ideally, we would like to have it in one quarter, but it will not spill over beyond the second quarter,"" Khara said."

"A painting which went missing from Air India's archives, was recently delivered to the airline's head office via post. The package did not mention the sender's name and had the painting made by Jatin Das for Air India, in a rolled up and damaged condition. The address registered by the sender was found to be a fake one in Gurugram. ","Summarise: On July 5th, India Today had reported that a painting, 'Flying Apsara', made by eminent painter Jatin Das for Air India in 1991 had gone missing from the airline's archives. Das had stumbled upon information that the painting made exclusively for the national carrier, had reached the open market.The ""missing"" painting now has miraculously resurfaced.A mysterious package arrived at Air India's head office, Airlines House, in New Delhi a week after Das raised a stink about the missing painting.This unnamed package contained the same said painting that Das had made for Air India. It was rolled up and delivered in a damaged condition.Air India immediately tried to trace back the sender. The courier, unfortunately, had been sent from an address in Gurugram that turned out to be fictitious.After India Today had highlighted the art loot, that appeared to be a larger malaise than the case of one missing painting, Air India had set up an internal enquiry committee to look into the matter.The committee has learnt that the painting was last seen in the office of a former executive director who worked out of the Delhi office of the airline a decade ago. It appeared, the lady in question, had left with Das' painting, post retirement.This former executive director has now been questioned about the painting. The internal committee will submit its complete report to the CMD of Air India in a week's time.This latest discovery only reaffirms what has been known within the airline's circles for a while - that retiring executives/officials have left with many a precious paintings and artefacts from the airline's collection after retirement, without informing.Air India says it has started a process of detailed audit of its collection, which will include ""physical verification, digitisation, cataloguing, classification, proper storage, and putting in place a security system"".When India Today contacted Jatin Das, he said he was yet to hear from Air India about 'Flying Apsara' and his other paintings too that he's sought details on."

"RBI has asked banks to resolve 55 identified high value cases of bad loans within a period of six months. Otherwise, the central bank would examine those cases and refer for resolution under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Earlier this month, RBI had identified 12 accounts for insolvency proceedings, which accounted for 25% of total bad loans of banks.","Summarise: By Kumar Dipankar New Delhi, Jun 22 (PTI) RBI has asked banks to resolve 55 high value cases of bad loans within 6 months or face the prospect of being directed to go in for the new insolvency resolution mechanism as part of the strategy to rein in unacceptable level of non-performing assets (NPAs). Earlier this month, Reserve Bank of India identified 12 accounts for insolvency proceedings with each of them having over Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding loans, accounting for 25 per cent of total NPAs of banks. RBI has asked banks to find solution for 55 identified NPA accounts within 6 months otherwise the central bank would examine those cases and refer for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), official sources said. RBI is of the view that banks should expedite the NPA resolution process for these cases as soon as possible, the sources said. In cases where a viable resolution plan is not agreed upon within six months, banks would be asked to file insolvency proceedings against the defaulters under the IBC, sources added. The banking sector is saddled with NPAs of over Rs 8 lakh crore, of which Rs 6 lakh crore is with public sector banks (PSBs). The 12 identified cases account for 25 per cent or about Rs 2 lakh crore of NPAs. IBC has defined time-frame for the resolution and there is 14-day time period for admission or rejection of a case by National Company Law Tribunal. After a case is accepted by NCLT, the creditor would get 30 days to hire insolvency practitioners and then the entire process to be completed in 180 days which will look at various possibilities including revival of projects or liquidation. RBI had set up an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) for such cases that may be considered for reference for resolution under the IBC, under which the 12 accounts were identified with fund and non-fund based outstanding amount greater than Rs 5,000 crore as of March 31, 2016. These measures were announced by RBI following an ordinance giving it wide-ranging legislative powers to fight NPAs. The ordinance authorised RBI to issue directions to banks to initiate insolvency resolution process in the event of a default under the provisions of IBC. "
"An exit poll conducted by India Today-Axis My India has predicted 202-220 seats for BJP in the 272-ward MCD. The BJP is in power in MCD for the past ten years. The exit poll has further predicted 23-35 seats for AAP and 19-31 seats for Congress. ""Exit poll results are according to our expectations,"" said Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari.","Summarise: The Bharatiya Janata Party is poised for a third consecutive term in Delhi municipal corporations with a brute majority, an exit poll conducted by India Today-Axis My India has predicted. The survey places the Aam Aadmi Party, which rules Delhi assembly, and the Congress trailing behind with a huge margin.Of the total 272 wards in the national Capital, the BJP is expected to win 202-220 seats while AAP and Congress 23-35 and 19-31 respectively, according to the poll survey. The voting percentage reflected in the polls give 43 per cent share to the saffron outfit while the AAP and Congress are almost equally placed at 24 and 23 per cent in the MCDs.The BJP lead is evenly spread in all three wards. The North MCD, which has 104 wards, is expected to give the BJP 78-84 seats, with AAP and Congress getting 8-12 each. Similarly, the 104-seat North MCD gives the BJP 79-85 seats. The AAP is placed somewhere between 9 and13 wards while the Congress at 7-11.The smaller East MCD, which has 64 wards, is expected to give the BJP 45-51 seats while the Congress 4-8 and the AAP 6-10.'POLL RESULTS ACCORDING TO OUR EXPECTATIONS'""Exit poll results are according to our expectations,"" state BJP president Manoj Tiwari told Mail Today. Attributing the positive survey results to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tiwari said, ""PM Modi has won hearts of people from sections of society. The BJP has taken all its decisions for welfare of India while the AAP has looted citizens of Delhi.""Tiwari said exit polls results prove while the Congress has lost ground across the nation, there is simmering discontent and anger among Delhi electorate against CM Kejriwal.The survey results also indicate that the BJP has made new inroads in the national Capital, with the last-minute change in state leadership with an extra emphasis on poorvanchali voters having paid off rich dividends. The exit poll has predicted that 45 per cent of the poorvanchali vote went in favour of BJP.This section of voters was a key target of the party when they handed over the reins of city unit to Manoj Tiwari in November last year.The recent by-election results in Rajouri Garden assembly segment too proved this when the BJP's poll percentage in the constituency increased from 38 per cent in 2015 to 52 per cent in 2017. The seat saw a sharp decline of nearly 34 per cent in the vote share of incumbent AAP from 47 per cent in 2015 to 13.1 in 2017. In previous several elections, the party's vote share had remained between 30 and 35 per cent in the national Capital.While AAP leaders were quick to point out anomalies in electronic voting machines, they were at pains to explain how an exit poll survey, which is gauged out of speaking to a voter exiting the election booth, can be linked with faulty EVMs.Congress leaders advised patience till April 26 when the counting occurs. ""These (polls) violate moral code of conduct. The results will come on 26. Let us wait till then,"" Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed said. The exit polls also indicate that the BJP has succeeded in making a dent in SC/ST and OBC votes in the national Capital. Apart from 54 per cent upper cast votes, the BJP is also expected to get 41 per cent of the SC/ST votes and 29 per cent OBC voters that are also considered the traditional vote bank of the Congress and the AAP.In 2012, the BJP bagged nearly 22 per cent of votes collectively in the three municipal corporations. In north MCD, the party polled 22.2 per cent, in South MCD 17.65 per cent and East 35 per cent.ALSO READ | MCD election 2017: Voting concludes, 53.58 per cent overall turnout"
"US President Donald Trump personally dictated a misleading statement which his son Donald Trump Jr delivered on his meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign, according to a Washington Post report. In his statement, Trump Jr said he discussed the adoption of Russian children with the lawyer who had offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton.","Summarise: Donald Trump personally dictated the press statement issued in the name of his eldest son Donald Jr that misleadingly downplayed the significance of a 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, a new report alleged on Monday night.According to the Washington Post, Trump personally intervened to prevent senior White House advisers from issuing a full and truthful account of the meeting on 9 June 2016 in which Donald Trump Jr, the president?s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort came face-to-face with four Russians. One of the Russian visitors was the well-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.The report, based on multiple though largely anonymous sources that included the president?s own advisers, has the potential to cause political, and even legal, trouble for the White House because it draws Trump himself much closer into the fray over the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a lightning rod in the Russian affair.Shunning the guidance of lawyers and overturning the view apparently reached by Kushner and his team of advisers that a full and frank accounting should be made, Trump reportedly dictated a statement on board Air Force One as he was flying back to Washington from the G20 summit in Germany. As would soon become apparent, it gave a very partial and distorted account of events.In the release the 2016 meeting was presented, in Trump?s own words, as ?a short introductory meeting? dominated by discussion of the adoption of Russian children that was ?not a campaign issue at the time?.That statement was presented to the New York Times on 8 July, and duly included in the newspaper?s first account of the meeting. But within 24 hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.On 9 July, the Times revealed that Trump Jr had been lured into talking to Veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father?s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger Trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the Democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: ?I love it?.The Trump Tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia in the Kremlin?s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the Republican nominee. The special counsel leading the investigation, Robert Mueller, is understood to be looking closely at the event and has reportedly asked the White House to preserve all documents relating to it.Until now, the president managed to keep some distance from the 9 June encounter, with his lawyers claiming that he knew nothing about it. But the new report that Trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president?s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.It comes as Mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether Trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired James Comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the FBI to back off investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn?s contacts with Russian officials.A lawyer for the president issued the Washington Post with a curt statement: ?Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,? Jay Sekulow said.The new details of the president?s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, Anthony Scaramucci, was dismissed from the White House after barely 11 days. The blunt removal was made on the first day of the new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, who has vowed to introduce the kind of discipline that the West Wing has been sorely lacking.The day began shortly before 5.30am with Trump tweeting ?No WH chaos!? and ended with him saying: ?A great day at the White House?. But as the Washington Post?s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the Trump Tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.According to the Post, senior White House officials together with the circle around Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the Trump Tower meeting publicly.Kushner?s team was reported to have decided that it was better to ?err on the side of transparency? because the whole truth would eventually come out.Trump, however, appeared to have seen things differently."
"Former CEO of Infosys Kris Gopalakrishnan has said that Indian IT companies need to learn to manage expectations of their employees as the growth rate slows down. He said that as technology is transitioning, companies must invest in retraining employees and employees must invest time in learning. He also said that automation has impacted services like infrastructure management and maintenance.","Summarise: Hyderabad, Jul 25 (PTI) As growth rate slows down, Indian IT companies need to learn to manage expectations of their employees, says a senior industry figure as he pitched for retraining of staff, in the era of rapid technology transition. When growth rate slows down, one has to manage the expectations of the employees within the company, former CEO of Bengaluru-headquartered IT major, Infosys, Kris Gopalakrishnan said. ""The number of promotions will come down because there are no openings at higher levels. So, you have to set expectations properly"", he told PTI. Secondly, the former President of Confederation of Indian Industry said, technology is transitioning and, so, employees will have to be retrained. ""One, the company must invest in retraining employees, and two, employees must invest time in learning. So, these are stressful situations for both employees as well as leadership in the companies"", Gopalakrishnan said. Last month, Indian IT industry body NASSCOM projected software export growth in 2017-18 at 7-8 per cent in constant currency, down from 8.6 per cent in the previous fiscal. The industry would add 130,000-150,000 jobs in the current financial year, it had forecast. Gopalakrishnan, the Chairman of Axilor Ventures, an early stage startup accelerator and venture fund, rejected suggestions that there is job-crisis in the Indian IT sector. ""Even NASSCOM has projected this sector will add one lakh-plus jobs this year also. Yes, growth rate has come down, recruitment numbers are lower but its still positive and the industry is still recruiting people"", he said. Gopalakrishnan, however, said hiring is slowing down because growth rate has come down. ""There have been some impact of automation on certain services. For example, infrastructure management services, maintenance services where automation has had an impact. Several tasks can be automated and those services will require less number of people. ""Now these are services where the work is actually quite repetitive and in the long run, these tasks are better done by machines because they are repetitive"", he said. Gopalakrishnan also shared his thoughts on opportunities and challenges for the industry in the coming decade, a period he said would be exciting for the sector as every industry is transitioning, and IT companies need to be ""reimaginative"" in helping such industries in the process.

"'Judge Uncle' is the presiding deity at the Devi temple in Kerala, and locals believe the judge saves 'innocents' trapped in legal hassles. Eighteenth-century judge Govinda Pillai, known for impartial judgements, had wrongly sentenced his nephew to death. Pillai ordered his own death for the error, and his soul is believed to be confined in a 'stone' at the shrine.","Summarise: Neck-deep in legal trouble, a mining baron from Bellary from Karnataka has finally decided to knock on the doors of the ?Judge Uncle? in neighbouring Kerala?s Kottayam district.The judge in this case is the presiding deity of a small shrine located at the corner of the Cheruvally Sree Devi temple of Kottayam with an ever growing reputation of helping people wriggle out of legal mess. The belief is Judge Ammavan (Uncle) does not disappoint and the mining baron mired in legal cases has made the trip to the temple to make a special offering.Those who throng the temple are controversial figures and to give them anonymity, the shrine opens just for 15 minutes and that too only in the night, after the main Cheruvally temple closes after evening prayers.Visitors at the temple are the veritable who?s who of south India: Malayalam actor Dileep is in jail for his alleged involvement in the abduction and sexual assault of a top actress and his brother Anoop was at the temple to offer special prayers on his behalf.P Gopalakrishnan, the president of the Travancore Dewasom Board that administers the famous hill shrine at Sabarimala was also here last November when a petition challenging its age-old tradition of not allowing women into the temple was being heard at the Supreme Court.The top court is yet to give its ruling on whether to allow women into Sabarimala, but devotees of ?Judge Uncle? believe his blessings are a sure shot way to salvation. The Bellary baron is facing a myriad of court cases including some relating to mine lease violations.?One of my cases will come up before the court soon and my astrologer advised me to visit the Judge Uncle,? he said on the condition of anonymity.According to folklore, the temple has its roots in 18th century when the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore had a judge named Govinda Pillai who was known for his impartial judgments. Once, his nephew was involved in a criminal case and Pillai ordered his execution. Later, evidence surfaced about the nephew?s innocence.Pillai was filled with remorse and he approached the king, requesting that he be punished for his erroneous judgment. The king said the judge must decide his own punishment, following which Pillai ordered his own execution. He also ruled that his body be exhibited at a public place for three days.Pillai?s commitment to justice moved many and the people later built a temple to ?give eternal peace to his soul?. The case diary with Pillai?s own observations on Palmira leaves ordering his execution serves as the deity of the temple.?People from faraway places come here. And many believers request the temple to keep their identity confidential,? said temple manager Gopinathan Nair.?People involved in minor disputes to major crimes come here with lot of hope,? said Deva Narayanan, a retired government employee. The Bellary mining baron currently doing the rounds of the temple happens to be just one of them. "

"The travel time for long-haul trucks has reduced by at least a fifth after GST was introduced, Road Transport and Highways Ministry has said. Trucks earlier took 50-65 hours to reach Kolkata from Chennai and it now stands reduced by 20%, it reported. The collection of sales tax at inter-state check posts had led to major traffic congestion, it added. ","Summarise: New Delhi, Jul 30 (PTI) Post-GST, travel time for long- haul trucks have reduced by at least a fifth, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has said. ""A typical truck spent 20 per cent of its runtime at interstate checkposts (pre GST)...Inter-state check posts removed, travel time of long-haul trucks, other cargo vehicles cut by at least one-fifth,"" the Ministry has said in a recent report. On an average, a truck in India runs an annual distance of 60,000 kms, as against 200,000 km in the West. The Ministry said trucks earlier took 50-65 hours in reaching Kolkata from Chennai and the travel time now stands reduced by 20 per cent. This was corroborated from interviews with transporters as well as GPS data of express transporters. Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, had last week said that Indias logistics sector stands to gain the most under the GST regime as costs will dip by almost 20 per cent. The Ministry said that pre-GST, the complex tax structure and paperwork forced the transport industry to spend a lot of resources on tax compliance and deposit of inter-state sales tax. Monitoring and collection of sales tax at inter-state check posts led to major traffic congestion at these points, resulting in slower movement of freight and passenger, and consequently higher costs and pollution, it said and added, an average Indian truck covers only about 50,000-60,000 km a year as against 3 lakh km done by a truck in the US. The unified tax regime has obviated the need for inter- state check posts. This will result in reducing travel time of long-haul trucks and other cargo vehicles by at least one- fifth, the report said. ""This, coupled with the proposed E-way bill that will require online registration for movement of goods worth more than Rs 50,000, will ease the movement of freight further, and bring in more transparency to the whole process. Efficient freight movement will also boost the demand for high tonnage trucks, which will in turn reduce the cost of transportation of freight,"" the report said. A single GST regime also means an optimised warehousing structure. Earlier, companies had to maintain warehouses in every state due to different taxation slabs. GST does away with the need to have such separate warehouses. This means, a leaner and smarter logistics chain. This will also encourage more investment in the warehousing business. Pre-GST, the statutory tax rate for most goods worked out to about 26.5 per cent. "
"All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Chief Asaduddin Owaisi has urged Muslims to stand in support of triple talaq just like the people of Tamil Nadu stood against the ban on traditional bull-taming sport Jallikattu. ""We also have our own culture. We will marry and divorce the way we want to. Nobody should direct us what we should do,"" Owaisi said.","Summarise: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has urged Muslims to stand up in support of triple talaq, saying people of the community should draw inspiration from the way the Tamils fought against the ban on hugely popular bull-taming sport jallikattu. Owaisi said that like the Tamils, Muslims also have their own culture and they should derive inspiration from the Tamil protests which he said made even Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bow down. Owaisi added that nobody should interfere with their customs of marriage and triple talaq.""In Tamil Nadu, people protested in lakhs to fight for their tradition. Modi had to bow in front of them. Are we any less than them? We also have our own culture. We will marry and divorce the way we want to. Nobody should direct us what we should do,"" Owaisi said. Owaisi's statement has come at a time when the Supreme Court is looking into the constitutional validity of triple talaq after several women's groups challenged the practice.WHY THE CONTROVERSYWhile the Allahabad High Court termed triple talaq unconstitutional in December, 2016, the Supreme Court is separately hearing another plea filed by Saira Bano who has challenged the three rules related to Niqah (wedding). These rules are: Talaq-e-Bidat, Niqah Halala and a man's right to have four wives.TALAQ-E-BIDATTalaq-e-Bidat is the practice which gives a man the right to divorce to his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times without waiting for her consent on the matter.In the Islamic tradition, some conditions were imposed for Talaq-e-Bidat. A man can divorce his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times during the period of a Tuhar, that is, the time period of two menstruation cycles.This could be done in one sitting or spread over the specified period. Under Talaq-e-Bidat, the wife's consent is not required for the separation.NIQAH HALALAThere have been instances where men have uttered 'talaq' three times in an inebriated state or in a fit of rage and have later wanted to revert to normal married life. However, the practice of Niqah Halala prevents the reversal of the triple talaq.According to the practice of Niqah Halala, a man is not allowed to marry the same woman after divorce even if both the partners are willing. Such a niqah is considered haraam (illegal).Niqah Halala requires that the divorced woman marry some other man and after obtaining divorce from her second husband, she can remarry her first husband the second time.WATCH: Owaisi urges Muslims to fight for triple talaq the way Tamils fought for jallikattu"

"Six months after being stabbed in her left playing hand, Czech tennis player Petra Kvitova won her first tournament at the Aegon Classic on Sunday. World number 12 Kvitova, playing in her second tournament since the December incident, beat Australian Ashleigh Barty 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in Birmingham. Kvitova had returned to action at the French Open in late May.","Summarise: Double Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has cautioned against making her one of the favourites to lift the title this year despite a stunning return from the hand injury that almost ended her career.The Czech won the Birmingham grasscourt event on Sunday in only her second tournament since returning from the severe injuries to her left playing hand sustained in a knife attack by an intruder at her home last December.She had hoped to continue her preparations at the Aegon International in Eastbourne this week, but pulled out of the tournament on Monday with an abdominal strain.Providing she recovers, the 27-year-old will be high on most people's lists of possible Wimbledon winners as she goes in search of a third title and many think she among the favourites.""Well, actually, I don't,"" she told reporters at a sun-drenched Devonshire Park.

"Bookmakers reportedly lost up to ?2,500 crore following India's loss to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday. As per reports, almost 50-60% punters from India and other nations, including Gulf countries, had placed their money on India, with 90% of them being Indian bookies. The odds were initially in favour of India at 80 paise for every rupee.","Summarise: When India lost to arch-rivals Pakistan in Sunday's Champions Trophy cricket final match in London, it not only broke millions of hearts but also left hundreds of bettors and bookmakers broke. According to an estimate, over 80-90 per cent Indian punters staked their money on the Men in Blue who were the firm favourites with a brilliant 12-2 record against their neighbours in ICC events. A total of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore was riding on the match that transfixed two nations and received eye-popping media coverage. Legal gambling in India is confined to horse-racing while casinos are allowed only in a couple of states. Sikkim is the only state that allows betting on sports including cricket. But the underground market in the country is worth thousands of crores, say observers. NO BETS ON HOCKEY MATCHBookies told Mail Today that huge sums of money were riding on Team India- not just within the country but also gambling hubs abroad such as in the Gulf nations- as this was one of the most-anticipated sporting events in months. However, there were no takers in the betting bazaar for the Hockey World League semi-final game on Sunday in which India demolished Pakistan 7-1. ""When the (cricket) match started, the odds were in favour of India. If the Men in Blue would have won the match, then punters would have earned 80 paise for every rupee while Pakistan's rate was around Rs 3.40,"" a Delhi-based bookie told this reporter. Pakistan inflicted a massive 180-run defeat upon title-holders and favourites India at the Oval in London to win the tournament featuring the world's top eight one-day international nations. PATRIOTISM MATTERS IN BETSThe bookmaker said almost all his 50-60 customers lost money as they had placed their bets on India. Till India dropped two early wickets, the rate chart in the gambling circuit was in favour Virat Kohli's boys. Even the massive total of 338 put up by Pakistan failed to deter bookies. History was unequivocally on India's side. The team had comprehensively beaten Pakistan when they met in the group stage. Experts claim that in an India-Pakistan match, patriotism plays a key role for bettors. ""It is certain that most of the Indian punters burnt their fingers in the match. The Indian team was stronger and had also defeated Pakistan in the tournament earlier, so huge money was riding on it. Even patriotism was at an all- time high and maximum bets were placed on Team India,"" said Jay Sayta, founder of GLaws.in, a gaming laws' web portal. According to experts, gambling was at its peak during the match as the viewership too was massive with premium advertisement rates. ""Not only Indians, but many international punters too burnt their fingers by putting money on India. Even after Pakistan ended their batting and put up a huge score before India, the odds were in favour of Virat's team due to the strong batting line-up and ability to chase down big totals,"" said another bookie from Mumbai. SIKKIM BOOKIES ON FIREThe only legal outlet for sports betting in India, which is in Sikkim, also witnessed a sharp rise in business volume. ""Our feeds before the match started were in favour of India as the rate was 1.6 while the rate for Pakistan was over 2.20. This means that if a player had placed Rs 100 on Pakistan, then he or she would have got Rs 220 in return. But most of the people invested on India,"" said Ratul Sethi of Golden Gaming. Sethi explained that the rates at the sports betting zone change at frequent intervals and as the game moved on rates shifted in favour of Pakistan. ""Not everyone playing at our outlet lost money as players can invest on different probables like scores in an over, next wicket, run rates, etc. We also promote sensible gaming so we advise players to place their bets reasonably,"" Sethi said. However, he said there were no takers for the India-Pakistan hockey match. While gambling is illegal in the country, Indians can lay their bets through UK websites with international credit cards and e-wallets. The bets are not only placed on the outcome of a match but also on other factors.Also read: Breaking TV sets, burning posters to crying on roads; How Indian fans found closure after Champions Trophy defeat "

There are a series of measures in the scheme which, if implemented, will cause a lot of problems for tourist taxi drivers.?The drivers are scheduled to meet chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday to discuss the matter.?It will be difficult for us to operate if the City Taxi Scheme is implemented.

"A self-styled email prankster, known as @SINON_REBORN on Twitter, has fooled recently-fired White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci thrice. The prankster fooled Scaramucci by posing as recently-fired Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, as a Russian envoy and finally as one of his friends. The prankster said he targeted Scaramucci because he had used mental health issues as a ""put down"".","Summarise: A suspected British prankster appears to have conned White House officials including Anthony Scaramucci into replying to him after pretending in email correspondence to be several different members of the Trump team.The man, who goes by the Twitter handle @SINON_REBORN, posed as Jared Kushner well enough to convince homeland security adviser Tom Bossert to reply to him, according to CNN. Bossert included his personal email address in the exchange.Named director of communications after having been denied a White House role earlier, the New York financier and Republican fundraiser promptlyÂ threatened to fire everyone in his teamÂ over leaks. He also staged a combative andÂ contradictoryÂ briefing room debut and talkshow tour; sought to bat away questions aboutÂ suspiciously liberal pronouncementsÂ in his past and support for Trump?s Republican enemies;Â deleted tweets; warred openly with the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and seemingly forced him out; compared the struggle to take healthcare away from millions of Americans toÂ Lincoln?s battle against slavery; poured obscene invective about leakers, Priebus and Steve BannonÂ down the phone to a New Yorker reporter; missed the birth of his son;Â saw his wife file for divorce; and was asked to resign.Trump?s first national security adviser ? one of four generals the president has employed ?Â resignedÂ after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russians during the election campaign. It was later reported that Yates hadÂ warnedÂ the White House Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail.The most shocking firing of them all.Â Trump sacked his FBI director, by messenger rather than in person, as congressional and justice department investigations into links between Trump aides and Russia gathered pace. Lest anyone retain any doubt about why Trump pressed the big red button, he told NBC in a primetime interview the firing was tied to ?this Russia thing?. The reverberations will be felt for some time yet.The long-suffering but loyal surrogate for the presidentÂ handed in his resignationin response to Scaramucci?s appointment. A Republican insider and Priebus ally, he never settled into the press secretary role afterÂ an infamous debutÂ in which he angrily insisted Trump?s fantastic version of crowd sizes at the inauguration were true. Achieving by way of Melissa McCarthy?sÂ lethal Saturday Night Live impressionÂ a somewhat dubious celebrity, his days at the White House were long rumoured to be numbered. His departure on a point of principle having seemingly been justified only 10 days later, he may now claim a sort of hollow vindication.The former Republican National Committee chair stayed loyal ? at least in public ? to Trump through Friday,Â when he was told his time was up. He stayed loyal after handing in his resignation too, rhapsodising about the president and his mission in interviews with CNN and, of course, Fox News. But it seemed Priebus?s card had alway been marked, less over his initial blocking of Scaramucci, which enraged the Mooch, or by his closeness to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, than by his private advice to Trump to quit the presidential race after 8 October, when the infamous Access Hollywood ?Gropegate? tape was published. The Washington Post reported that Priebus was thus never considered a member of the ?Oct 8th coalition?, a name for the inner cabal of Trumpites who have never wavered, however low their boss?s reputation has sunk.The man also fooled Scaramucci, the White House communications director who was fired on Monday, by pretending to be Reince Priebus, the former Trump administration chief of staff with whom he was believed to be in open warfare.In a series of emails, the man posing as Priebus baited Scaramucci, accusing him of being ?breathtakingly hypocritical? and saying ?at no stage have you acted in a way that is remotely classy?.Scaramucci responded: ?You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize.?The heated exchange continued, with the prankster writing: ?I can?t believe you are questioning my ethics! The so called ?Mooch?, who can?t even manage his first week in the White House without leaving upset in his wake. I have nothing to apologize for.?Scaramucci replied: ?Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello. You are right there. My family is fine by the way and will thrive. I know what you did. No more replies from me.? The White House has confirmed it is looking into the matter. ?We take all cyber related issues very seriously and are looking into these incidents further,? press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNN.Reince (me) giving @Scaramucci something to think about. He never replied haha pic.twitter.com/hutjACmogRAn excerpt of what I emailed to @Scaramucci whilst playing the part of Jon Huntsman Jr. Apparently this didn't seem out of the ordinary?! ?? pic.twitter.com/6INHJi3KCDThe man, who described himself as a ?lazy anarchist? on his Twitter profile, told CNN that his actions were meant to be ?humorous? not malicious.?I?m not trying to get the keys to the vault or anything like that.?He has previously convinced Scaramucci that he was the ambassador to Russia-designate Jon Hunstman and tricked Hunstman himself into believing he was the president?s son Eric Trump. He also fleetingly convinced Eric Trump he was his brother, Donald Jr. "

"The Maharashtra government has launched a scheme to cover medical insurance of up to ?10 lakh of 335 sitting legislators, 837 former legislators, and their families. This is reportedly aimed at curbing the use of fake bills in the medical reimbursement scheme the legislators were covered under earlier. The insurance scheme will cost the state almost ?10 crore a year. ","Summarise: The Maharashtra government has decided to give free medical insurance cover of up to Rs10 lakh to all sitting and former legislators and their families.

Each premium works out to Rs85,000.Legislators were earlier covered by the government?s medical reimbursement scheme. A committee headed by top medical officials would examine and approve medical bills submitted by legislators. The annual expenditure on such reimbursements was about Rs9crore to Rs10 crore. Under the new scheme, six of a family, regardless of their age and medical condition, are collectively entitled to an insurance cover of up to Rs10 lakh. If the cover is exhausted, the policy has a contingency provision of Rs10 crore for all legislators. Family members of legislators won?t have to undergo any medical tests, said an official. Chief minster Devendra Fadnavis took the decision three weeks ago, said the official.Earlier, the government had proposed an annual insurance cover of Rs15 lakh for each legislator. This would have increased the state?s financial burden by Rs4 crore. With the insurance scheme, the government expects to curb the use of fake bills for reimbursements. ?In many cases, we found that legislators had submitted fake and duplicate bills to claim medical reimbursement,? said an official from the finance department. Officials who clear medical bills said the insurance scheme would be better than the existing one. ?We have a network of 4,700 hospitals across the country under the insurance scheme. It will be a cashless facility and the insured members will not have to pay from their pockets. The reimbursement scheme covered only five critical and 27 serious diseases,? he added.READMaharashtra lawmakers get monthly salary hike with immediate effectMaharashtra govt releases ?894 crore as crop insurance for farmers"

He was arrested from an encounter site in Anantnag district.  The arrested terrorist, identified as Sandeep Kumar Sharma alias Aadil, was part of three attacks last month on security forces in the Kashmir Valley.

"The Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has demanded separate reservation of 5% within Other Backward Class quota, reports said. In 2015, the Rajasthan government had provided 5% reservation for  Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadia Lohars, Gadarias and Raikas under Special Backward Classes, taking the total reservation in Rajasthan to 54%. However, the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move.","Summarise: The Gujjars demand for reservation in Rajasthan can fast become an albatross around Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's neck. After the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move to bring five castes, including Gujjars, under the Special Backward Castes (SBC) category, the Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has begun to demand that a separate reservation of 5 per cent be created for the nomadic castes within the Other Backward Classes (OBC), thus abiding with the total cap of 50 per cent on reservation. This, the agitating Gujjars feel, can help avoid the court's scrutiny.The Rajasthan government had, through a Bill in September, 2015, provided 5 per cent reservation for 5 castes under the Special Backward Classes (SBC), thus taking the total reservation in Rajasthan to 54 per cent. These castes include Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadia Lohars, Gadarias and Raikas.RAJASTHAN GOVERNMENT IN DILEMMA OVER DEMANDThe Rajasthan government is presently in a dilemma about whether it must accept the demand. If it yields, it runs the risk of antagonising other castes whose share in the reservation quota will then drop. Such castes include the Jats and Bishnois, among many others.Currently, according to the Supreme Court, the cap on reservation under different categories in government jobs is 50 per cent. Before the government decided to bring in a Bill for 5 per cent reservation in September last year, caste-based reservation in government jobs in Rajasthan stood at 49 per cent. That included 21 per cent for OBCs, 16 per cent for Scheduled Castes and 12 per cent for Scheduled Tribes.Also read | Raj Govt tries to assure Gujjars on quota after stir threatThe High Court had mentioned that five castes (Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadarias, Raikas and Gadia Lohars), previously falling in the category of OBCs and getting benefits of reservation, have been brought under SBCs to provide five per cent reservation, exceeding the ceiling of 50 per cent. The court observed that the SBC Commission and the state government had failed to discharge their obligation, as per the directions of the apex court, to collect quantifiable data. The court, citing the Supreme Court's 9-judge bench Indira Sahani judgement, stated that there were no special reasons for creating a separate 5 per cent reservation pool for these castes. The court mentioned that according to a report, there were 25 more backward castes.GUJJARS FEEL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT KEPT PROMISEThe representative Gujjars, who have witnessed several violent agitations in the past, feel that the government has so far not fulfilled its promise of ensuring Amendment to the 9th Schedule to bring in the requisite changes. In May 2015, members of the Gujjar community began agitating in Bharatpur by once again blocking railway tracks. After that, representatives of the Sangharsh Samiti were called in for a dialogue. As per Himmat Singh Gujjar, spokesperson for Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (RGASS), the government during the dialogue that happened following the May agitation had promised that changes would be made in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution at the Central level, thus fulfilling the government's promise on the issue of reservation.

"The Pufferfish, commonly known as Blowfish and Fugu, is considered a delicacy in Japan even though it is fatally poisonous. Reportedly 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide and without a known antidote, Fugu poisoning can cause death by asphyxiation within 10 minutes. Japan strictly controls its restaurant preparation by law, and chefs take 3-10 years' training to prepare it properly. ","Summarise: Trust the Japanese to do something the rest of the world can't even fathom, and ace it!For starters, the fish dish in question is called Fugu in Japan, or pufferfish, as the rest of the world knows it. Though it comes in various varieties, we most commonly know this fish as 'blowfish'--yes, the one that inflates at the prospect of any threat.First things first, this is what the pufferfish looks like:Okay, that's not a pretty picture. And that's not even an adult pufferfish. Let's just save you the gory details and get to the point. Here's what you REALLY need to know about this Japanese delicacy:1. It takes a chef three to ten years in training to be able to cut the fish right so it doesn't remain poisonous for the consumer. 2. Restaurant preparation of Fugu is strictly controlled by law in Japan and several other countries.3. Accidental poisoning by Fugu can lead to death within 10 minutes.4. Fugu contains lethal amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin in its inner organs, especially the liver, ovaries, and the eyes; the skin is usually non-poisonous.5. The poison in Fugu paralyzes the muscles while the victim stays fully conscious. The poisoned victim is not able to breathe, and eventually dies from asphyxiation.6. According to Wikipedia, Fugu poison is 1200 times stronger than cyanide, and has no known antidote yet. "
"The Punjab government on Friday slashed the VIP security, including that of the Chief Minister, by withdrawing nearly 2,000 personnel. CM Amarinder Singh's security has been reduced from 1,392 to 1,016 personnel. As per the government, the security has been cut down to create the necessary infrastructure for better policing.","Summarise: New Delhi, Apr 21 (PTI) Punjab today cut down on VIP security, including that of the chief minister, by a whopping 2,000 personnel and decided to deploy them to ensure better policing and improve the law-and-order situation in the state. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also directed the police to review the arms and ammunition licences to check unbridled proliferation of arms in the hands of criminals. The decision was taken at a high-level security review meeting chaired by Amarinder and attended by Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Suresh Arora and Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) Dinkar Gupta, besides Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar. The withdrawal of security also includes pruning of the chief ministers security from 1,392 to 1,016 personnel. Some 1,500-odd security personnel have been withdrawn in other categories of constitutional and government functionaries, an official spokesperson said after the meeting. The chief minister has already ordered withdrawal of all deployment along his travel routes and his security is likely to be cut down further at the next review meeting, based on fresh reports on threat perceptions. Amarinder has made it clear that he does not want security beyond the ""bare necessity"". He has also directed the police and other agencies to review the existing security policy, which was approved by the Punjab cabinet and subsequently notified by the Department of Home Affairs and Justice in 2013. The chief minister underlined the need to provide only ""need-based"" security, taking the latest threat perception for individuals into account. With the existing security policy being three-year-old, he directed the police to call for fresh reports from the state and central agencies to map the threat perceptions of individuals who have been provided security and then decide on the quantum of security. This was the second security review meeting of the Amarinder-led Congress government since it took over the reins of Punjab last month. At the first meeting in March of a committee headed by the DGP (Law-and-Order), as many as 749 police and paramilitary personnel were withdrawn from various categories of protectees. The Congress manifesto for the Punjab Assembly polls had clearly stated that the ""unhealthy"" trend of the use of policemen by politicians and bureaucrats for their personal security will be discouraged strongly. Amarinder expressed grave concern at the threat posed to internal security as a result of arms proliferation, which had led to several incidents of law-and-order violation in the state. He ordered a comprehensive review of all the arms licences issued by district magistrates and police commissionerates. Amarinder also directed a propriety audit of the arms licences issued after the notification of the Arms Rules, 2016, which came into effect from July 15, 2016. "

"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once called Mahatma Gandhi ""a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir... striding half-naked up the steps of the Viceregal Palace."" Churchill was unhappy at Gandhi's participation at the Second Round Table Conference in London in 1931. Churchill even suggested Gandhi should be allowed to die if he goes on hunger strike.","Summarise: It now appears that Winston Churchill's ""seditious fakir"" comment during his wilderness years is linked to an occasion when Mahatma Gandhi posed for portraits at Kingsley Hall in London.The painting, by Ukrainian-born artist Jacob Kramer who spent all his working life in England, was made when Gandhi was at the Second Round Table Conference in 1931.During the London visit, Gandhi had invited Kramer to capture his likeness for posterity. The image, made with black and white chalk on buff paper, shows the icon of peaceful protests smiling mischievously, seemingly aware that he had the British Establishment on the run.In London from September 12 to December 5, 1931, Gandhi stayed at Kingsley Hall and used an office at 88 Knightsbridge during this visit. Here, according to the Mahatma's grandson Gopal Gandhi, a day was allotted to artists and Kramer is said to have made three or four drawings of the Mahatma.His impressions were published in the Yorkshire Post on January 31, 1948, after Gandhi's death: ""I was with him from 10.30 am until 6 pm. It was one of his silent days and neither of us spoke a word. But one did not need to speak to Gandhi to be aware of his personality. A shrivelled little man though he was, he filled that room with an extraordinary spiritual force. He was the most impressive subject I have ever had."" Gandhi had vowed to spend every Monday in silence.Shockingly, around the same time, the United Kingdom's future prime minister Winston Churchill (1940-1945 and 1951-1955) unflatteringly described Gandhi thus: ""It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious middle temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the east, striding half-naked up the steps of the viceregal palace, while he is still organising and conducting a defiant campaign of civil disobedience, to parley on equal terms with the representative of the kingemperor."""

Roger Federer?s name is on the trophy here. He just needs to add the final few flourishes. History beckons. His heart is beating that little bit faster as he walks to the baseline to serve. Cilic, like a condemned man heading to the gallows, takes his place, ready to return. The sun?s come out at last. Of course it has. But Federer still needs some points. He loses the first, sending a backhand long. 0-15. But he steadies himself with an accurate serve. Another one makes it 30-15 and he gees himself up with some Swiss-German. He has two championship points when Cilic screws a forehand return off to the right. Applause. Silence. A missed first serve. A rally. It?s not over yet. Cilic finds the angles to force Federer to hit a forehand long. 40-30. Federer misses another first serve. There?s only one thing for it: a second-serve ace down the middle. That?s it! Roger Federer is the Wimbledon champion again! He looks very emotional, almost in tears, but he remembers that there?s a man who?s feeling a fair bit more emotional than him right now and he walks to the net to shake hands with poor Marin Cilic. It?s all over. Federer is the owner of an historic eight Wimbledon titles and a mere 19 majors overall. Take that, Rafa.Updated

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 4-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is serving to stay in the final, although he in reality he left it spiritually a long time ago. He is, however, determined to make Federer serve for it. His fifth ace of the match sets him up for a rare simple hold, even though there is the blemish of a double-fault. Federer will serve with new balls for his 19th grand slam title. ?Given this has been such an anti-climax, and is finishing so quickly, do you think they could ask Federer to knock up against one of those back-walls, so we get to see a bit more of him playing on centre court?? says David Wall. ?Even he can only have a couple more years on the tour and it?ll leave an enormous hole when he does retire.?Updated

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic sends down an ace to make it 15-0, but it?s 15-30 when he flicks a backhand wide. He challenges to no avail. Then he nets a forehand, even though Federer was stranded on the baseline. Two break points. They double up as championship points. And it really is Federer?s to lose now. Cilic wheels into another forehand ... and dumps it into that blasted net. Federer is two games away from his eighth Wimbledon title.

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic holds with an ace out wide. He clenches his fist, glaring at his box, resolve and steel returning. You forget athletes are humans with real emotions. The sport of tennis is so hard because you're out there all by yourself.Updated

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): He?s obviously not winning this and it?s a terrible final, but I?d say Cilic has done a lot to enhance his reputation in the past few games. It would have been very easy for him to throw in the towel. But Federer?s still so miserly, scrooge-like when he?s serving. He offers Cilic false hope by letting this game drift to deuce - the drama! - but he still holds.

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Alarm bells are ringing when Cilic spoofs a forehand into the net for 0-30. Somehow, though, he fights to 40-30, one backhand winner taking the breath away. This is gutsy from a man who is enduring some very public turmoil. Unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when Cilic nets a forehand. Admirably Cilic saves it with some serve-volley. Then he holds. This hurts, but tanking would hurt even more. ?Is this a record for unforced errors?? says Henry C. ?I feel sorry for Cilic but has got to be one of the worst finals ever. Hoping that something will change, but it is saying something when the first two sets lasted less than the Women?s final.?Updated

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer lopes forward off a second serve, planting a deft backhand volley out of reach for 15-0. He holds to 15. No mercy. There?s no room for the stuff at this level.

Federer leads 15-0 when Cilic sends a forehand return wide. It?s 30-0 when he attacks a short return with a whipped forehand. Soon he has three set points. He takes the first with a swinging ace down the middle. I don?t mean to be insensitive, but this is the worst men?s final for a long time. The doctor is back on court.Updated

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is now using serve-and-volley on every point, which is enough to make you think he isn?t interested in long rallies. He?s drawn into one at 40-30, though, and he nets a forehand for deuce. Federer?s not going to give him anything now. He gives a second serve the treatment, a sweet backhand return earning him a break point. Federer can?t take it, though, knocking a return miles wide and challenging the call for absolutely no reason at all. But when Cilic sends down an 134mph serve, Federer?s flicked return brings up a second break point. Federer knocks a backhand down the line, the stretching Cilic hangs out his racket and volleys long. Federer will serve for a two-set lead. Updated

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 1-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Of course, it?s one way to get the crowd on your side when you?re playing Federer. The sympathy vote. It?s not going to knock Federer off course, though, as he holds to 15. They retreat to their chairs. There?s no sign of Cilic requiring any more treatment.

3.02pm BST
15:02

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-3 Federer (*denotes server): Another cheer for Cilic when he wins the first point of this game with a big serve. The game goes to 30-all. The last time I saw something like this in a grand slam final was when Sabine Lisicki collapsed emotionally in the 2013 final. It?s not clear if he?s distressed or physically hurting. But he does manage to hold to 30, keeping this final alive.Updated

The medical team and supervisors have left the court. It seems that Cilic, who was bawling his eyes out a moment or two ago, is going to continue. He doesn?t want this to end early. But this is awful to see, even though he?s given a huge ovation by the crowd as he prepares to serve.Updated

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 0-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic makes himself feel a bit better with an ace for 30-15. It?s not long before Federer has a break point, though, with Cilic?s game in danger of coming apart at the seams. The errors keep on coming. Cilic pulls a backhand wide and Federer leads by a set and a break.

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): The good news for Marin Cilic is that this isn?t over yet. The bad news is that Federer hasn?t lost a grand slam match from a set up since the 2014 Wimbledon final. He?s such a strong frontrunner. That?s probably why Cilic hit his chair with his racket during the changeover. He suspects this final might already be running away from him. Federer begins the set with a straightforward hold to love.Updated

Serving to stay in the set, Cilic?s pulled back to 30-all from 30-0. He decides it?s time to serve and volley, but he sets Federer up for a backhand pass, which is a bit like showing Leo Messi on to his left foot. Set point. A big serve forces Federer to return wide, but an errant forehand from Cilic brings up a second set point. Cilic is showing signs of strain. He misses a first serve. His second serve clips the top of the net and skitters wide to gift Federer the first set! That was all a bit flat.Updated

First set: Cilic* 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic gambols into a 40-0 lead. Federer makes it 40-15 with a crisp forehand return down the line, then 40-30 with a preposterous, hypnotic backhand drop shot that draws a deeply satisfied sigh from the crowd. Suddenly there?s uncertainty in Cilic. From a position of dominance, it?s deuce after a double-fault, the class of Federer unsettling the Croatian. Fortunately for Cilic, Federer can?t take advantage. He holds to keep the distance between them to a single break.Updated

First set: Cilic 2-4 Federer* (*denotes server): With Federer ahead, Cilic looks to haul himself back into the set with some aggressive hitting. Federer?s backhand slice seems to head wide - it?s called out - but the umpire overrules the line judge. The point?s replayed, Federer skips into a 15-0 lead and it?s 40-0 before Cilic has time to regroup. Federer clinches his first hold to love without any problems at all in the end, but that could have been a much tougher game.

First set: Cilic* 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Trailing 0-15, Cilic goes for a drop shot. Federer reads it. The 35-year-old springs forward to dink. Cilic hurtles forward, prods a backhand from left to right and falls heavily, leaving the court open for Federer to dab a backhand away for 0-30! That exchange seems to take the wind out of Cilic, who?s facing three break points after an awful forehand. He saves the first two, Federer?s returns drifting long. Not the third, though. Cilic doesn?t move his feet and he nets a poor backhand to hand the first break to Federer. ?Could the Prime Minister?s presence be a bad omen for fans of Roger Federer?? says David Wall. ?She?s been poison for what seemed to be sure-things in recent times.? Will Federer end up shedding a solitary tear?Updated

First set: Cilic 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic is starting to use his power to good effect, returning heavily and drawing an error from Federer for 0-15. It?s tense. Federer?s second double-fault of the match makes it 30-all. Hitting deep, Cilic is starting to boss a few rallies. A penetrative backhand makes Federer net a slice, bringing up the first break point. Federer nets a first serve. He goes for a body serve with the second, though, and Cilic stiffs a backhand into the net. The game goes to deuce and Federer ends up holding to considerable relief around Centre Court.

First set: Cilic 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): We begin with a see-saw rally, Federer on top at first and making most of the running before Cilic takes control with a big forehand down the line, forcing the Swiss to net a backhand. A smooth serve makes it 15-all. But Cilic appears to have shaken off the nerves. He repels a big first serve and asserts himself with a huge forehand for 15-30. Sensing danger, the crowd cheers when Federer makes it 30-all at the net. The game goes to deuce after Federer?s first double-fault, but he holds. There?s a lot of nervous energy out there.

First set: Cilic* 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Here we go, the 131st men?s singles final, with Marin Cilic serving first after Roger Federer elected to receive. It begins. Cilic sees a second serve rammed down his throat and dribbles a forehand into the net to make it 0-15. A purposeful, urgent start from Federer, while Cilic looks a little tight, slamming a forehand long to make it 15-30. The Croatian?s nervy. He?s grateful to see Federer miss a couple of backhands, but the game goes to deuce when Cilic slaps a forehand into the net. Here?s early pressure. But Cilic does well to deal with it and hold. A break there would have been sub-optimal.Updated

The players are making that familiar walk through the corridors of Centre Court. Well, it?s familiar for one man. Not so much for Marin Cilic. Cilic is leading the way here. They?re walking past so many photographs of old champions, so much history, so much pomp. The sense of occasion - it?s impossible not to feel it. It?s nothing new for Federer, of course, and he looks so relaxed. He?s seen it all before. Eventually they emerge to a huge ovation. The camera doesn?t linger long on Cilic, who?s smiling slightly. It?s soon fixated on Federer, following him as he makes his way to his chair, before finding his father in the crowd. Of course Federer Snr?s wearing a RF cap. Updated

Hello. It?s interesting. If you?re actually at Wimbledon, you don?t actually have to watch a Roger Federer match to know how it?s going. You don?t even have to listen the umpire calling out the score after each point. All you need to do is stand outside Centre Court and listen to the crowd. If they?re in a state of unbridled glee verging on pure lust, if they?re oohing and aahing and panting and fawning after every point, you can safely interpret that as Federer dominance. Enthusiastic applause: Federer?s won the point. Grudging applause: the other bloke?s not playing ball.This is how it?s supposed to go. This is Federer?s kingdom, his palace from palace. There?s no desire for him to be pushed too hard. There?s no interest in an upset. Sure, it?s nice to see Federer?s opponent muster some defiance, just to keep the show going for as long as possible, but he?s not actually supposed to win. He?s supposed to be a good boy, know his place, let the master do as he pleases and lose in straight sets. You are the comedy sidekick, there to be willingly loaded into a cannon, to have a custard pie slammed in your face and raise no objections; take it, it?s all you?re good for here. This is the deal. There might be some pretence from the crowd that they?d like to see something resembling a contest, some confected jeopardy, like a tie-break in the first set, which is really about as dangerous and adventurous as splashing out on the Creuset pan instead of the John Lewis own brand (other brands are available). The Fed-lust can only stand so much risk.Centre Court, in all its stuffy blazered glory, really just wants to bask in reverie for Roger. He?s nice like Tim, but he?s even better at tennis. Andy is stubborn and pretty brilliant, so he?s an excellent alternative. Novak is mysterious and brutal, but he can be a bit bad-tempered. Rafa is sweet and amazing and Spanish, a fine young man, ever so handsome, but he isn?t an artist. None of them turn up on court wearing a cardigan or a blazer - that?s true class. None of them are Roger. They love Roger. WE LOVE YOU ROGER. I LOVE YOU ROGER. MARRY ME ROGER. Did I say that out loud? Oh, what am I like!This is what stands in front of Marin Cilic today: Federer the player and Federer the legend. He isn?t supposed to win. It?s not that the seventh seed isn?t an interesting player, of course, or incapable of playing the kind of tennis that could urinate all over the eagerly anticipated Swiss coronation. It?s just that he isn?t Roger. Nor is the former US Open champion much of a character, a card. He?s just a guy who?s good at tennis. Unlike Goran Ivanisevic, the last Croatian man to win Wimbledon, there?s no Good Marin, Bad Marin and Emergency Marin. There?s just Marin. It might not be enough to win their affections.It could be enough to win this final, though. Cilic is playing excellent grass-court tennis this year and he crushed Federer on the way to winning the US Open in 2014. At his best, shorn of nerves and anxiety, he is a mighty proposition. If the 28-year-old doesn?t freeze, he could do something here. He was two sets up against Federer in their quarter-final last year. Underestimate him at your peril. But for all that it has been possible to catch a few signs of Federer frailty over the past fortnight, he still won that match and he still hasn?t really come close to dropping a set at this tournament. And last year he had that knee injury. This time he?s well rested, having worked out how best to protect his physical resources after that knee injury, and he?s been untouchable this year, playing quick, sharp-shooting, ask-no-questions tennis that is intended to kill the argument as quickly as possible. It?s brought him another Australian Open title, his 18th major, and titles in Miami and Indian Wells. It could bring him an historic eighth Wimbledon title.This is Cilic?s second grand slam final. It?s Federer?s 11th here and his 29th overall. He?s 36 in less than a month. This isn?t normal. But he isn?t normal. You wonder when it?s going to end. Is it going to end? You know what they want on Centre Court. More Roger. They can?t get enough Roger. And do you know? It?s because there?s nothing else quite like it.Play begins at: 2pm BST.Updated

The police said that Ilyas is a resident of Muzaffarnagar, where he owns and runs a grocery shop that he also uses as a front to sell arms to ?regular customers?.?The accused brought the weapons and cartridges, which we found were manufactured at an illegal arms factory owned by one Mobin, who is also a co-accused in the case. Mobin had told Ilyas to deliver the arms to a contact in Ghaziabad and was to give him the identity of the contact once he reached Ghaziabad,? Manish Mishra, the assistant superintendent of police, said.However, before Mobin could give him the information, the police nabbed Ilyas along with the cache of illegal weapons. Officers said that the bigger weapons are generally sold for Rs20,000 apiece while the smaller ones, shaped like pistols, are sold for Rs10,000 each. Sources said that illegal countrymade pistols are generally manufactured from spare parts of trucks, especially, the lower end of the steering gear, which are shaped into barrels as they are strong and can withstand the firepower. The illegal weapons are then shaped by the manufacturers with the help of heat generated in a furnace.There have been several instances wherein the police have nabbed arms suppliers in Ghaziabad.In April, the police arrested a man who was carrying 12 pistols and 11 magazines, and had come to Ghaziabad from Muzaffarnagar to deliver weapons.In January, the Ghaziabad police arrested two persons from Shatabdipuram and recovered three illegal pistols and 600 semi-built magazines (used to store cartridges in weapons) from their possession.?Ilyas has also been to jail earlier in connection with supplying and manufacturing arms. We suspect that the accused was on his way to meet Mobin in Pasonda and the purchaser was to be identified later on. Our teams have launched a search for Mobin, who is presently absconding,?

"A rare 60-kg sperm whale on Thursday washed ashore at Rajodi beach near Mumbai. The fishermen said that the seven-and-a-half-foot-long mammal looked injured and died during rescue operation. ""This species of whale has not washed ashore along the state's coastline for more than a decade,"" said a member of the Konkan Cetacean Research Team.","Summarise: In a rare incident along the state?s coastline, a seven-and-a-half-foot-long  sperm whale washed ashore at Rajodi beach, Virar, around 3pm on Thursday.Though the state mangrove cell confirmed that it was a sperm whale, the officials are unclear whether it was a juvenile whale or a pygmy or a dwarf (subspecies). The whale weighed 60 kg. Fishermen from Rajodi said they spotted the whale close to the shoreline towards the south side of the beach and it looked injured. ?The mammal most likely hit a large rock close to the shoreline and got injured. We tried pulling it out, but it died as soon as it came close to the beach. We informed the forest department but nobody showed up at the spot,? said James Rodrigues, a fisherman and Rajodi beach resident. ?Along with seven others, we buried the animal near the spot where it had washed ashore. We have not seen a mammal like this at this beach before.?When HT contacted the forest officers from Vasai-Virar, they were unaware of the beaching incident. According to the Konkan Cetacean Research Team (KCRT), the last documented evidence of this mammal to have beached is from Goa in March 2016. ?This species of whale has not washed ashore along the state?s coastline for more than a decade. It is extremely rare and our team is going to collect tissue samples and study the mammal,? said Mihir Sule, member, KCRT. This was the 15th case of dead marine animal carcass washing ashore along Mumbai?s beaches. Between 2015 and 2017, 74 carcasses have washed ashore along the city?s coastline. Both the dwarf and the pygmy sperm whales are protected under schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Owing to lack of information about the species, the mammal is not listed under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). "
"UK roadside repair firm AA on Tuesday lost over Â£200 million (nearly ?1,690 crore) or nearly a fifth of its value. This came after shares fell as much as 18% during the day after it fired its Executive Chairman Bob Mackenzie with immediate effect for 'gross misconduct'. However, his son said he resigned over an 'extremely distressing mental health issue'. ","Summarise: The AA has fired its boss, Bob Mackenzie, for ?gross misconduct?, with immediate effect, wiping nearly a fifth off the value of the company and making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250.?Bob Mackenzie has been removed by the board from his role as executive chairman, from his other roles and as a director and as an employee of the company, for gross misconduct,? the AA said.A spokesperson for the roadside repair company said the sacking was a ?personal conduct related matter?, but gave no further details. It is not believed to involve fraud.However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie?s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned. The statement said his father had tendered his resignation and resigned his directorships due to acute ill health. ?He is very unwell and has been admitted to hospital,? it said. ?The family trusts that all parties will act responsibly towards a loyal servant of the company in a manner which reflects the stress he has been suffering.?The company declined to comment beyond its initial statement.The shock announcement sent shares down as much as 18% at one point. The shares closed down 14%, wiping about Â£200m off the value of the company.Mackenzie, 65, has been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in a stock market flotation of the company. His previous roles include chairman and chief executive of National Car Parks and its subsidiary Green Flag, a rival car breakdown business.The AA said Mackenzie?s responsibilities would be split, with Simon Breakwell, a non-executive director since 2014 and a founder of the travel company Expedia, appointed as acting chief executive. John Leach, who was senior independent director, has been appointed as chairman.The company had already announced plans to split the combined roles of executive chairman, with the aim of appointing a chief executive.In a trading update published alongside the announcement of Mackenzie?s departure, the AA said it was confident about the company?s long-term prospects but its financial performance in the first half of 2017 had been hit by a number of factors.?The financial performance in the first six months has been negatively impacted by the effect of erratic work load patterns on an inherently fixed cost base. This was especially true in June and July which saw significant spikes in demand.?We now expect the full-year performance to be broadly in line with that of the last financial year.?The AA said paid members totalled 3.33 million in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6,000 compared with the same period a year earlier. The company would publish first-half results on 26 September. ?At that stage, Simon Breakwell will be in a position to provide an update on our plans,? the company said.Analysts at Liberum noted their surprise at Mackenzie?s departure, adding that they ?do not believe that it is fraud-related?.They revised down their expectations for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by 3% to Â£403m, but said the company had made progress in some areas. ?After the accelerated [stock market listing] in July 2014, management had acquired a strategic asset akin to a desirable residence in Mayfair, where the plumbing and electrics were in need of investment,? the Liberum analysts said. ?We now believe that the face-lift is largely complete.?Some of the key metrics are generally encouraging, although that may be lost today. The transformation may have taken longer but there is tangible evidence of improvement.?The AA said that existing board member Andrew Blowers would replace John Leach as senior independent director, while Martin Clarke continues as finance director."

"FIFA on Tuesday announced that penalty shootouts will be used to decide drawn matches between teams in the group stages of the FIFA World Cup, which shall feature 48 teams from the 2026 edition onwards. The move is aimed at minimising the risk of teams colluding in their final group games to eliminate others from the tournament.","Summarise: The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has robustly defended the decision to expand the World Cup from 32 competing national teams to 48, which will begin with the 2026 tournament, in the face of immediate criticism from top European clubs. At a meeting in Zurich, Fifa?s rule-making council unanimously passed the new format, which will create a first round of 16 groups, from which two of three teams will qualify and proceed to a knockout competition beginning with 32 countries.Fifa has projected that the increase to 48 countries will generate around $1bn more income, and $640m profit, from greater television rights and sponsorship. Infantino said the money will be reinvested in football; he has promised all Fifa?s 211 member countries? associations $5m a year to aid development.Speaking after the meeting, Infantino argued that the expanded tournament will increase interest in football worldwide by involving more countries, while not burdening players with more matches.Responding robustly to criticism from the German football association (DFB) and European Club Association (ECA), which derided Fifa?s decision as having been taken for ?political reasons rather than sporting ones,? Infantino said: ?We are in the 21st century, and we should shape the World Cup for the 21st century. Football is more than Europe and South America; football is global.?Fifa?s football associations, particularly in Africa and Asia, have historically been in favour of the tournament?s expansion, which Infantino said will give them all more places in the finals. Precise numbers are yet to be decided, as are some of the format?s details, including whether drawn first-round group matches could all be decided on penalties. The host for the 2026 tournament is due to be considered in 2020, with a bid featuring the US, either on its own or in conjunction with one or both of Canada and Mexico, the overwhelming favourite.Arguing that qualification for the World Cup provides a key boost to football development in smaller countries, Infantino pointed to the advances of Iceland, Wales and Hungary in last year?s European Championship as examples of ?beautiful stories?. European football?s governing body, Uefa, decided in 2008 to expand its tournament from 16 countries to 24, and Europe?s representatives on Fifa?s council supported the World Cup increase, despite the opposition from leading clubs.In a statement the ECA, which has 220 member clubs in 53 European countries, said that the 32 team format is ?a perfect formula? and suggested that Infantino had in mind electoral support from Fifa?s member associations, which each vote for for the president. Questioning the ?urgency? with which so historic a decision was taken, less than a year since Infantino was elected, the ECA said ?stakeholders? who will be ?impacted? had not been properly involved.?We understand that this decision has been taken based on political reasons rather than sporting ones and under considerable political pressure, something ECA believes is regrettable,? the statement said.Infantino declined to respond to reports immediately after Fifa?s announcement that the Spanish football league, La Liga, which claimed it was not consulted at all, is considering a lawsuit. Last week the DFB president, Reinhard Grindel, expressed ?immense reservations? about the proposed expansion, arguing that allowing 16 more countries to qualify would reduce the quality of the football.Referring to his election last February on a proposal to expand the World Cup to 40 teams, Infantino said the prime objection from European clubs had been to increasing the number of matches played, and the tournament?s length. He said Fifa administrators had since examined four different formats and found that the 48-team expansion could address those concerns.The immediate move to a 32-team knockout competition after the two matches played by each country in the first round of 16 groups, means the finalists will have played seven games, the same as in the current format. The tournament can still be played over 32 days, as it is now. Infantino pointed out that Uefa?s expansion lengthened the European Championship by a week, and incorporated one more match for the finalists.Arguing that the quality of football is improving around the world, and pointing to the elimination of both England and Italy by Costa Rica in the last World Cup in 2014, Infantino said: ?Increasing the size of teams which can participate will increase the investment in football development, to make sure that the teams can qualify.?The FA?s chief executive, Martin Glenn, had said his preference was ?to keep the tournament smaller,? but he acknowledged that ?smaller countries understandably want to be part of the tournament.? The English representative on the Fifa council, David Gill, did not attend the meeting because of a previously arranged visit to Australia, but given the strength of support for the expansion, he had been expected to vote in favour.In a statement after the decision, the FA said: ?We will work with Uefa, Fifa and the other European associations to understand how the 48-team Fifa World Cup will work. The priority has to be consideration of the potential impact on fans, players, teams and leagues, and also recognition of the importance of sporting integrity and commercial viability.?"

"A recent video of Lashkar-e-Taiba co-founder Amir Hamza has reportedly been recovered showing Hamza provoking jihadis to wage war in the northeastern states of India.

Banned terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) is now provoking jihadis to wage war in the northeastern states of India. The malice intention of Lashkar came under the radar of security agencies through a video, where its cofounder Amir Hamza is seen instigating his cadre to spread violence in Northeast, including Darjeeling and Sikkim.A recent video, believed to be shot in Lahore on July 19, has left security agencies in a tizzy. Citing example of China military standoff with India over Doklam plateau, Hamza is asking jihadis to break up Indian states.""We will fight in Sikkim, we will fight in Bhutan, we will fight in Darjeeling, we will fight in Srinagar,"" Hamza can be heard saying in the video, which is in possession of Mail Today. Agencies have also authenticated the video clips. Recently, several terror activities came under the radar of security agencies from Northeast states but the fresh threat has raised alarms bells in the Home ministry.Senior officials claim Hamza was seen recently in Lahore and this was his first public appearance since JuD chief Hafiz Saeed's house arrest in January. Hamza, in the video, threatens to create violence in several states of the country. ""For one Bangladesh, we will take seven states,"" says Hamza.He has also praised China and talks about the dispute over the 40-km-long stretch between Doklam and Bangladesh border. This video is the first such proof of Lashkar-e-Taiba's direct involvement in the Northeast and their strategy to work along with China. ""if India will send its army in Bhutan to counter China, then along with Pakistan, Chinese troop will enter Srinagar,"" Hamza said in the video.Hamza was designated global terrorist by US in 2012 and is wanted by India for the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai that claimed over 160 lives and left more than 300 injured. He was detained by Pakistan authorities along with 26/11 key operative Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi soon after the attacks.

"Traders' body CAIT has suggested that the first nine months of GST, from its rollout date of July 1, should be treated as a trial period. No punitive action should be taken against businesses for procedural mistakes to allow them to get familiarised with the new regime, it added. ""Let this period be a learning period,"" it stated.","Summarise: New Delhi, May 19 (PTI) Traders body CAIT today suggested the first nine months of GST, from its rollout date of July 1, should be treated as a trial period and no punitive action taken against businesses for procedural mistakes to allow them to get familiarised with the new regime. Commenting on the outcome of the GST Council meeting that concluded today, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said that classification of goods under different tax slabs of GST are by and large fitted in the correct basket and it is expected that goods will become cheaper under the new indirect tax regime. ""However, on the other side, several items which have been placed under higher category of tax rate will disturb the pricing structure and pinch the common man,"" said B C Bhartia, president of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). He pointed out that items like pickles, sauces, and instant mixer pertaining to food processing which are consumed by large number of people, have been placed under the higher tax rate of 18 per cent. The CAIT further said that while the GST should be implemented from the scheduled date of July 1, the remaining nine months of the current fiscal ""may be declared as trial period"" and except habitual offenders, no action should be taken against traders for procedural mistakes.

A Chandigarh hospital's doctors ruled out the possibility of abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim who is nearly eight months pregnant. The Supreme Court on Monday had asked the hospital to examine if the pregnancy can be terminated after hearing a plea for the rape survivor. A Chandigarh district court had rejected the plea when she was six months pregnant.,"Summarise: Gynaecologists from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) have ruled out the possibility of aborting the nearly eight-month pregnancy of a 10-year-old rape victim. ?It will be just like delivering a baby,? said a senior gynaecologist from the premier government hospital, which was on Monday tasked by the Supreme Court with examining if the pregnancy can be terminated. As per SC  directions, the PGIMER has constituted an eight-member committee that would formally check if the health of the girl and the child would be adversely affected if the pregnancy is allowed to extend to its full term up to delivery. HT interacted with some gynecologists from the PGIMER and also Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH),  Sector 32, to know their views. Almost all of them ruled out aborting the 30-week foetus due to medical reasons. A senior gynaecologist from GMCH-32 told HT, ?The baby cannot be aborted. They can go to any apex court or any hospital. The child has crossed the time to abort the baby.??Ten- to 12-year old children getting pregnant are rare cases. In the last five years, I have seen only two such cases; one mother was 10 and the other, 12,? said a PGIMER gynaecologist.  She said that in both cases the babies were delivered safely via Caesarian (C-section). ?The mother is so fragile that she cannot bear the trauma of labour pain and natural delivery. We could not let the 10-year-old undergo so much pain; so in that case we conducted elective C-section, wherein delivery was done even before the labour pain began,? she added. When asked if C-section is safer than natural delivery among pregnant children, she said, ?So far, no study on that has been done.? About risk factors, she said, ?Surgically, the risk is as much as it is in any other surgery. But  the pregnancy will be more complicated than that in adult women.? Meanwhile, on the panel constituted by the PGIMER are Dr D Behera, head of pulmonary medicine department, as chairperson; Dr Vipin Koushal from the hospital administration as member-secretary; Dr Vanita Suri, head, gynaecology; Dr Surjit Singh, head, paediatrics; Dr N Khandelwal, head, radio-diagnosis; Dr Ajit Awasthi, head, psychiatry; Dr Swati Kumari, head, internal medicine; and Dr Manoj Kumar Rohit from the cardiology department.The SC bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar had also asked member-secretary of the state legal services authority to assist the panel in the examination to be held on Wednesday. The next hearing is on Friday.India has a 20-week legal ceiling on abortion. Law allows a woman to abort but only after doctors confirm it is necessary to save the mother?s life. The SC has been receiving petitions, including from rape victims, to terminate pregnancies beyond 20 weeks; and uit has referred these to medical experts before any orders. Recently, the court gave a 10-year-old rape victim from Haryana the permission to abort.The Chandigarh case came to light 10 days ago after the girl was taken to hospital for stomach ache. The girl was raped allegedly by her maternal uncle, a hotel worker, repeatedly over seven months. He has been arrested. The girl?s family hails from Nepal and has been residing in servants? quarters in one of the southern sectors in Chandigarh. Her father is a watchman and the mother works as a domestic help."
"The website of National Institute of Technology, Srinagar, was hacked on Monday, with hackers posting ""Free Kashmir"" and anti-Indian Army messages. The portal was hacked by a group named Team Pak Cyber Skullz, who also posted messages demanding the removal of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister.

The servers were downed after the attack.While the nation was busy grappling with an early-morning terrorist attack on a CRPF station at Sumbal in Bandipora district of Kashmir, which was foiled by jawans and left four terrorists dead, pro-Kashmir freedom elements, most probably from across the border, hacked the website of the premier institute and posted, ""Ask for milk, we shall give you sweets. Ask for Kashmir we shall kill you."" This, ironically, has been the clarion call of the Right wing, which it employs towards those asking for Kashmir's freedom.""We saw that the website had been hacked when some students tried to access it to see a few articles of the syllabus. We were shocked to see that the website bore anti-India literature, anti-Indian Armed Forces propaganda and a call to leave Kashmir and give it freedom,"" one of the students told Mail Today.WHAT THE POSTERS SAID The posters, uploaded in the name of one 'All Pak Cyber Skullz Members', said. ""We shall fight till the last breath. What shall a man not pay for living? Everyday 100s of innocent people are abused, raped and even killed in Kashmir by Indian army, a third of the deaths are children. We don't want war.

All these are done just to attain power),? Rahul said, addressing party workers. Gandhi arrived on a two-day visit to tribal-dominated Bastar district of Chhattisgarh to rejuvenate the party in this Maoist hotbed ahead of 2018 assembly polls. The Congress, which is in out of power in the state since 2003, is still a formidable force in the Bastar region. Tribals and Dalits are often at the receiving end of the counter-Maoist operations in the region, alienating them from the Raman Singh-led BJP government. He asked the workers to strengthen the party and also gave some tips on how to effectively use social media to mobilise support. ? He( Rahul) emphasised on the importance of social media and gave us some useful and effective tips,? said a party worker present in the session.Addressing the closed door session, Gandhi termed the BJP as a ?party of lies?, and egged on his party functionaries to defeat the saffron party with their ?power of truth.??They (the BJP) tell the same lie again and again to make it appear true just for their vested interest to secure power,? he said. On Saturday, Gandhi will address a rally to protest the proposed disinvestment of state-owned NMDC?s steel plant coming up in Nagarnar area of Bastar.The NDMC employees, their unions and local people are against the Centre?s plan for a strategic disinvestment of the plant. The Congress is trying to cash in on their grievances ahead of the assembly polls.

"Discus thrower Harpreet Singh, a silver medalist at the 2004 Commonwealth Youth Games, was arrested with two other people in Delhi on Friday for peddling a party drug 'meow meow'. As per the police, 25 kilos of the drug worth ?50 crore were seized from the trio. Harpreet had reportedly once faced a six-month drug ban in his athletics career. ","Summarise: An International-level discus thrower, who had bagged two medals for the country, was among three persons arrested from New Delhi railway station with more than 25 kilos of Mephedrone drug (popularly known as meow-meow in party circles), police said on Friday. The estimated worth of the drugs seized from the accused is around Rs 50 crore.The discus thrower, identified as Harpreet Singh, won a silver medal at the 2004 Commonwealth Youth Games in Australia and a bronze at the 2006 South Asian Games, before a foot injury cut his career short. ?Harpreet?s career was marred with doping charges that had once also fetched him a six-month long ban,? Sanjeev Yadav, DCP (special cell) said.The other two arrested men were identified as athlete Amandeep Singh, who was pursuing a diploma in hospitality and tourism in London, and Hanish Sarpal who had enrolled in a management course at a university in London, but later dropped out.Harpreet and Amandeep were nabbed by a special cell team from New Delhi station on Wednesday evening, after the police were informed that the duo would be smuggling meow-meow drugs from Mumbai to the capital.Police said 25 kilos of Mephedrone was seized from the possession of the accused. Mephedrone is popular in parties and is used as a substitute for cocaine. Wednesday?s recovery was possibly the biggest seizure of the drugs from the national capital, police said.An officer said the interrogation of the duo led the police to Hanish, who was nabbed from west Delhi?s Janakpuri with another 650 grams of the same drug. Police claimed that their probe has revealed the drugs as smuggled from the African subcontinent to Mumbai and from there pushed into various Indian cities and even exported to other countries. The arrested trio was allegedly working as the Delhi-based agents of an international drug syndicate.Police said the men had been lured into joining the racket with promises of large sums of money after their careers failed.Harpreet had allegedly entered the drug trade after trying his hand in the real estate business which crashed because of a slump in the market.Harpreet was the All India Inter University Champion for three years from 2006 to 2008, but failed to make it to the Indian squad for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. A foot injury that he picked up before the Commonwealth squad selection ensured that he didn?t make the cut, said the officer. The other two suspects had allegedly met in the United Kingdom while studying. The duo tried to find work there, but had failed and returned to India and got sucked in the drug trade."

"Actress Shabana Azmi has said that filmmakers should decide if they want to cut scenes in their film and not any board. She added that the Censor Board should only certify films and not censor scenes. ""However much you say CBFC?is an autonomous body...people taken on the board...have some kind of affinity with the ruling party,"" added Shabana.","Summarise: Amid all the controversy over how much say the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), informally called Censor Board, should have in the final version of a film, veteran actor Shabana Azmi says that the whole system needs a revamp. She believes that filmmakers, not the CBFC, should decide whether any scenes get the chop or not.Talking to Hindustan Times during the Delhi premiere of her latest film, The Black Prince, Shabana was all for overhauling the current system, in which the CBFC has the power to demand cuts in a film before certifying it. ?It?s so wrong to call the CBFC the Censor Board in the first place. It is here to certify films; censoring any scene is not its prerogative,? says the actor. Her reply comes in the context of being asked if she would ever take charge of the Censor Board, as her industry colleagues Asha Parekh, Sharmila Tagore and Anupam Kher have done. The 66-year-old Shabana, who has always been vocal on the issue of censorship, asserts, ?The fact is that the Cinematograph Act of 1952 needs serious revision, and we have to leave it to the filmmakers to decide whether they are open to any cuts in the film or not.??There was the Justice Mukul Mudgal panel, in which Javed [Akhtar] saab was also a member, and they also suggested many changes. So, we are only waiting for those changes to be implemented.?Referring to the Shyam Benegal Committee, which, in its 2016 report,  recommended fairly drastic changes in how the CBFC works, Shabana adds, ?[The committee] has been saying exactly the same thing: that censorship or [the] certifying system needs to change. Even before this committee, there was the Justice Mukul Mudgal panel, in which Javed [Akhtar] saab was also a member, and they also suggested many changes. So, we are only waiting for those changes to be implemented.?Drawing comparisons with the West, Shabana says that the CBFC needs to adopt the American system for film certification and move away from the current British ideology that is being followed.?However much you say that the CBFC?is an autonomous body, the fact is that those people are taken on the board [who] have some kind of affinity with the ruling party.??The system that we follow here for film certification is a British system, wherein you take about 30-odd people from within society and you literally make them sit on judgment to change the morality of the country every five years, according to the political dispensation of that time. Because, however much you say that it?s an autonomous body, the fact is that those people are taken on the board [who] have some kind of affinity with the ruling party, whether it?s the Congress or the BJP. Now, this is not good for any country?s art,? she says.Shedding light on how the Motion Picture Association of America works, Shabana explains, ?I?ve been saying for a long time now that we should follow the American system, where you have a board of people from within the film industry and they decide... the filmmaker decides that ?I don?t want a single cut in my film, but I recognise that it?s not suitable for children, or not suitable for people of [a] certain age, so I am willing to take an XXX certificate.? Or if a filmmaker says that ?No, I want my film for universal release, so I am open to the suggested cuts.? So [filmmakers] need to have the power to decide, and not any board.?Follow @htshowbiz for more"

"Over 1000 new words, including net neutrality and facepalm, were recently added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Seussian, relating to the works of Dr Seuss, and tech term abandonware were also added.

The new entries include borrowings from foreign languages as well as words from tech, medicine, pop culture, sports. ""The work of revision is ongoing and constant; even though it seems that the latest slang gets the most attention when dictionaries issue lists of new words, the additions come from the whole range of registers and from every corner of the language,"" the Merriam-Webster Dictionary said in its blog. ""These are words that have demonstrated frequent and increasing use in a variety of sources, and are therefore likely to be encountered by a reader - and should be in the dictionary,"" it said. In some cases, terms have been observed for years and are finally being added; in others, the fast rise and broad acceptance of a term has made for a quicker journey. Seussian relating to or suggestive of the works of Dr Seuss is now in the online dictionary, along with conlang - an invented language like Klingon - and prosopagnosia (an inability to recognise faces). New tech terms such as net neutrality, abandonware, and botnet have also been included in the list of new words. The word ghost now has a new meaning - to abruptly cut off all contact with someone, such as a former romantic partner, by no longer accepting or responding to phone calls, instant messages. Supercentenarian, EpiPen and urgent care are among the words added from the field of medicines. Prosopagnosia, sometimes called ""face blindness,"" is a neurological condition that has only relatively recently been the subject of study. New words from the ever-expanding vocabulary of cooking and food include arancini, EVOO and macaron, as well as sharp tools of the kitchen santoku and chefs knife. Political terms include town hall and truther as well as SCOTUS and FLOTUS. The word snollygoster - a shrewd, unprincipled person - returned to the dictionary after being dropped in 2003 because it had fallen nearly completely from use. Familiar words combine to give us metaphors or imagery like train wreck, side-eye and weak sauce. "

"After nine months of pollution, Delhi's air quality showed improvement for the first time on Thursday with the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reading 77. When the AQI is below 100, air quality is considered 'good' with air pollution posing little or no risk. The decrease in pollution levels could be due to the monsoons.","Summarise: After a nine-month gap, Delhi breathed ?good? air on Thursday.

Because of this, long range transport of pollutants from outside Delhi is minimal. Around 20%-30% pollution gets reduced because of this,? SAFAR chief Gufran Beig told HT.?Because of the monsoon, there is lot of moisture in the air. This is also another reason for this decreasing pollution levels over the past 2-3 weeks,? Beig said.However, as per the Central Pollution Control Board AQI standards the air quality on Thursday was under the ?satisfactory? range.

The air quality was good in the city on Thursday as mixing height was higher compared to other days,? Dr Dipankar Saha, additional director and head of the Air Laboratory at the CPCB told HT.According to him, the weather conditions, which is not too hot and on the cooler side, also aided in the good air quality.The 24-hour rolling average of PM10 and PM2.5 were recorded at 77 and 44?g/m3 respectively on Thursday, according to SAFAR. PM2.5 and PM10 are ultra-fine particles that are the dominant pollutants in Delhi.

"A study has revealed that the UK and Netherlands act as channels of corporate offshore investments from tax havens, with both countries accounting for almost 40% of such investments. Out of the 24 offshore financial centres identified, 18 had links to the UK. Every year multinationals in the EU avoid paying Â£38-158 billion in taxes using tax havens.","Summarise: Almost 40% of corporate investments channelled away from authorities and into tax havens travel through the UK or the Netherlands, according to a study of the ownership structures of 98m firms.The two EU states are way ahead of the rest of the world in terms of being a preferred option for corporations who want to exploit tax havens to protect their investments.The Netherlands was a conduit for 23% of corporate investments that ended in a tax haven, a team of researchers at the University of Amsterdam concluded. The UK accounted for 14%, ahead of Switzerland (6%), Singapore (2%) and Ireland (1%).Every year multinationals avoid paying Â£38bn-Â£158bn in taxes in the EU using tax havens. In the US, tax evasion by multinational corporations via offshore jurisdictions is estimated to be at least $130bn (Â£99bn) a year. The researchers reported that there were 24 so-called ?sink? offshore financial centres where foreign capital was ultimately stored, safe from the tax authorities.Of those, 18 are said to have a current or past dependence to the UK, such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and Jersey.The tax havens used correlated heavily to which conduit country was chosen by the multinational?s accountants.The UK is a major conduit for investments going to European countries and former members of the British Empire, such as Hong Kong, Jersey, Guernsey or Bermuda, reflecting the historical links and tax treaties enjoyed by firms setting up in Britain. The Netherlands is a principal conduit for investment ending in Cyprus and Bermuda, among others. Switzerland is used as a conduit to Jersey. Ireland is the route for Japanese and American companies to Luxembourg.In terms of the purpose, on paper, of the corporate structures, the Netherlands specialises in providing holding companies. The UK provides head offices and fund management and Ireland offers financial leasing and the provision of head offices.?Our results show that offshore finance is not the exclusive business of exotic small islands far away,? the researchers write in an article for theacademic journal Scientific Reports. ?Countries such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom play a crucial yet previously hidden role as conduits of offshore finance on its way to tax havens.?Dr Eelke Heemskerk, who led the research, said that the work showed the importance of developed countries cleaning up their financial sectors.He said: ?In the context of Brexit, where you have the UK threatening, unless they get a deal, to change their model to be attractive to companies who want to protect themselves from taxes, well, they are already doing it.?The Netherlands says they won?t let the UK be an offshore tax haven. That?s because they don?t want them taking their business.?"

"The members of a Norwegian anti-immigrant group have been trolled for mistaking a photograph of six empty bus seats for a group of women wearing burqas. The post, shared on  the closed Facebook group Fedrelandet viktigst (Fatherland first), garnered comments like ""Get them out of our country"" and ""Could be terrorists."" It was shared on the group as a prank.","Summarise: A Norwegian anti-immigrant group has been roundly ridiculed after members apparently mistook a photograph of six empty bus seats posted on its Facebook page for a group of women wearing burqas.?Tragic?, ?terrifying? and ?disgusting? were among the comments posted by members of the closed Fedrelandet viktigst, or ?Fatherland first?, group beneath the photograph, according to screenshots on the Norwegian news website Nettavisen.Other members of the 13,000-strong group, for people ?who love Norway and appreciate what our ancestors fought for?, wondered whether the non-existent passengers might be carrying bombs or weapons beneath their clothes. ?This looks really scary,? wrote one. ?Should be banned. You can?t tell who?s underneath. Could be terrorists.?Further comments read: ?Ghastly. This should never happen,? ?Islam is and always will be a curse,? ?Get them out of our country ? frightening times we are living in,? and: ?I thought it would be like this in the year 2050, but it is happening NOW,? according to thelocal.no and other media.The photograph, found on the internet, was posted ?for a joke? last week by Johan SlÃ¥ttavik, who has since described himself as ?Norway?s worst web troll and proud of it?, beneath a question asking the group: ?What do people think of this??SlÃ¥ttavik told Nettavisen and Norway?s TV2 he wanted to ?highlight the difference between legitimate criticism of immigration and blind racism?, and was ?interested to see how people?s perceptions of an image are influenced by how others around them react. I ended up having a good laugh.?It went viral in Norway after Sindre Beyer, a former Labour party MP who said he has been following Fatherland first for some time, published 23 pages of screenshots of the group?s outraged comments.?What happens when a photo of some empty bus seats is posted to a disgusting Facebook group, and nearly everyone thinks they see a bunch of burqas?? he asked in a post shared more than 1,800 times. The comments suggested the vast majority of the anti-immigrant group?s members saw the photo as evidence of the ongoing ?Islamification? of Norway, although a small number pointed out it was in fact a picture of bus seats. One warned the group was making itself look ridiculous.Beyer told Nettavisen: ?I?m shocked at how much hate and fake news is spread [on the Fedrelandet viktigst page]. So much hatred against empty bus seats certainly shows that prejudice wins out over wisdom.?The head of Norway?s Antiracist Centre, Rune Berglund Steen, told the site that people plainly ?see what they want to see ? and what these people want to see are dangerous Muslims?.Norway recently became the latest European country to propose restrictions on the wearing of burqas and niqabs, tabling a law that will bar them from kindergartens, schools and universities. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria all restrict full-face veils in some public places.The country?s minority government, a coalition of the centre-right Conservatives and the populist Progress party that faces elections next month, said in June it was confident it would find opposition support for the move.Per Sandberg, then acting immigration and integration minister, told a press conference that face-covering garments such as the niqab or burqa ?do not belong in Norwegian schools. The ability to communicate is a basic value.?"

Raghavendra Rao, a legend of Telugu cinema.The actor has been roundly bashed on social media for referring to Rao?s penchant for ?showing [the heroine?s] midriff and throwing fruits and flowers at it?, in a chat with the comedy group East India Comedy. This was said as part of Taapsee?s anecdote about her first film, but this got angry fan reactions like ?ungrateful?, a ?hypocrite? and a ?backstabber? for supposedly forgetting her roots and taking a dig at such a veteran.Talking to Hindustan Times, Taapsee says, ?Er, what did I take a dig at? He?s known for that. I have stated a fact, and if you?re taking it in a derogatory manner, that?s your problem.? She says, ?Trust me, him or me, both of us are really unperturbed by whatever I have said, because I?ve seen the video and he has seen it, too, along with his family, and we are all laughing at it.?Maintaining that she didn?t say anything ?disrespectful? about anyone, Taapsee quips that the only person she ?disrespected or made fun of? in the entire chat video was herself. In it, she had said, ?...When my turn came, maybe because my midriff wasn?t quite ready, they threw a coconut on me! I don?t know what is so sensuous about a coconut hitting my midriff!?She tells us, ?And I still stand by all of that. Whatever I mentioned there was not to make fun of anyone expect me, and it was purely on the basis of facts. I didn?t say anything derogatory or disrespectful to anyone.

Raghavendra Rao. ?The only person I was concerned about was my director and his family, and I got [a] good response from them ? they told me that they all sat together and saw the video, and laughed at it, and I guess that?s all that matters,? she says.She might have more to say on this subject, but Taapsee is biding her time. ?Until now, I haven?t really gone out and commented on it, and there?s a reason I?m waiting for the point [when] everyone will hear what I have to say, rather than me saying the same thing ten times to ten different people,? the actor says. ?Right now, I?m just sitting back and seeing how people can have so much of hatred in them that they really want to make so much of negativity out of nothing.?Follow @htshowbiz for more"

In attendance were minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan, minister of state for external affairs VK Singh, Major General (retd) GD Bakshi and cricketer Gautam Gambhir. Only a handful of students, however, turned up for the advance celebration of Kargil Vijay Divas, which actually falls on July 26.Slogans such as Jahan hue balidaan Mukherjee (Syama Prasad Mukherjee), woh Kashmir humara hai. Sare ka sara humara hai (The Kashmir where Mukherjee died is ours) echoed on a relatively empty JNU campus as a group of over 300 people walked, fluttering the tri-colour, from the main gate to the convention centre. During the programme, JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, who stood in support of the march, requested Dharmendra Pradhan, and VK Singh, to procure an army tank to be exhibited in JNU. ?We request you to help us procure an army tank so that it could be put in JNU.

Those people were against putting Indian flag on the campus. I ask them why? How dare they say that? Is this our land or Pakistan?s? Why won?t the flag be here? Today, they have been answered,? he said.Supreme Court advocate Monika Arora voiced the same opinion. ?Those people who shouted slogans were followers of Marx and Stalin, the people who not only destroyed themselves but also the countries they belonged to, with their ideas. These ideas spread like a disease and if not treated then it develops into gangrene.?

Joshua, who extended his unbeaten record in professional boxing to 19-0, knocked down the 41-year-old former champion twice in the title bout.","Summarise: Anthony Joshua delivered one of the great nights in British boxing annals by stopping Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko in the 11th round to be crowned IBF, WBA and IBO world heavyweight champion in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.Britain's unbeaten IBF title holder earned a sensational victory by knocking down the 41-year-old former champion twice in the 11th and penultimate round before the referee stepped in to save Klitschko from any more punishment.What was hailed as the biggest fight night ever staged in a British ring, watched by the largest crowd for a boxing show in Britain for 78 years, lived up to its billing.It was a thrilling contest which saw both combatants clamber off the canvas seemingly on the verge of defeat and looks destined to be recalled as one of the great heavyweight title fights.Joshua survived a knockdown for the first time in his professional career in the sixth round and looked close to surrendering his unbeaten record until his late bombardment forced the stoppage.In a sensational fifth round, Joshua knocked down Klitschko only to end up hanging on desperately at the end of the round as the Ukrainian launched a remarkable comeback.The veteran had even looked the more likely winner as he defied a 14-year age gap and was outboxing Joshua in the latter stages until the Briton produced a blistering finish to take his unbeaten record to 19 straight stoppage wins.Both men had to dig deep and both looked close to exhaustion before the 27-year-old Joshua's youth, fitness and sheer power took over in a penultimate round that sent the huge crowd into ecstasy as two barrages sent Klitschko down.""What can I say? 19-0, three-and-a-half years in the game. As I said, I'm not perfect but I'm trying,"" Joshua told the cheering crowd from the ring.""As boxing states, you leave your ego at the door and you respect your opponent. So a massive shout out to Wladimir Klitschko.""""The best man won tonight and it's a massive event for boxing,"" responded Klitschko after his second defeat in succession at the hands of a British heavyweight following the loss of his titles to Tyson Fury 17 months ago after an 11-year reign.""Two gentleman fought each other. Anthony was better today. It's really sad I didn't make it.""The fight attracted a gate that had not been matched for a British show since Len Harvey fought Jock McAvoy for the British light-heavyweight title at another London venue, White City, in 1939.The mutual praise between Joshua and Klitschko echoed the civilised and respectful way the two former Olympic champions had behaved in the build-up to the contest but there was nothing civil about the brutal punishment they dished out to each other.After four rounds of feeling each other out, with Klitschko's movement and Joshua's power quite apparent, the crowd were not prepared for an astonishing fifth round.First, Joshua launched a blistering left hook and followed up with a flurry of punches that saw the Ukrainian drop to his knees and, when he rose groggily, take a standing count.Klitschko suddenly looked old and the end seemed nigh as Joshua roared in to finish the job but that was when he found his champion's spirit in his desperation, landing a big left of his own to leave Joshua in real peril."
"A 35-year-old woman was allegedly kidnapped and gangraped by three men in a moving car for three hours on Monday night, the police said. The woman was kidnapped in Sohna, Gurugram, where the accused repeatedly raped her before driving to Greater Noida and throwing her out of the car. She was found near a hospital, while the accused are absconding.","Summarise: A 35-year-old woman was gangraped on Monday in Sohna, Haryana in a horrific ordeal that is believed to have lasted several hours. According to the woman, three men in a Maruti Swift car kidnapped her and drove her around on the streets of Sohna for several hours while repeatedly raped her. She was then driven all the way to Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh where she was thrown out of the car near Yatharh Hospital in Kasna. Based on the girl's written statement, Noida police have filed a First Information Report under Indian Penal Code Section 376D, which deals with gangrape. WHAT HAPPENED? According to the woman's statement, she was abducted by three men in a Swift car from near her home in Sohna, Gurgaon at 8.45 pm on Monday. The men then drove her around for four to five hours, taking turns to repeatedly molest and rape her. With the woman still in the car, the men then drove all the way to Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh where they flung her out of the car near the Yatharth Hospital in Kasna around 4 am. She recounted her horrific ordeal with locals in the area who then called the Noida police. Noida police reached the spot, informed their counterparts in Gurgaon and took the woman for a medical examination at Yatharth Hospital.

Kumar also told India Today that there were certain discrepancies in the woman's initial statements and the police was working to verify and corroborate her claims. It remains unclear what route the alleged rapists took while driving from Sohna to Greater Noida. Kumar said the police is working to establish how the woman was brought to Greater Noida. The woman hails from Rajasthan's Bharatpur city and came to Sohna around 10-15 days ago and was staying with her family.DRUNK MEN?Meanwhile, initial investigation into the incident has indicated that the men were drunk or were drinking while the alleged gangrape occurred. Some beer bottles were also found from the spot which indicates that the accused persons were inebriated at the time,"" a senior Greater Noida police officer told news agency PTI.The men are also believed to have threatened the woman with dire consequences if she approached the police. While an FIR has been filed, no arrests have yet been made in the case. Police teams are examining CCTV footage to identify the route the Swift car took to travel the around 80-kilometer distance from Sohna to Greater Noida. The FIR has been registered by Noida police's Kasna unit and Gurgaon police has said they will be assisting the Noida cops. ""We have taken the details from SSP Gautam Budh Nagar, Love Kumar.

The UP government will help the Haryana Police with whatever help they need to probe the incident, Singh said. COPS FOUND SLEEPING - UNRELATED INCIDENTWhile questions remain over how the alleged rapists were able to travel all the way from Gurgaon to Greater Noida without being stopped by cops, in an unrelated development, two Noida policemen stationed at a Police Control Room van were shunted out after they were found sleeping during the night.The Swift car in which the alleged gangrape occurred is not believed to have passed through the area in which PCR van was stationed. However, an unidentified person, who reportedly shot a video of the sleeping cops, sent the footage to Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Love Kumar after news of Monday's alleged gangrape came to light.

As regulators try to establish a reliable nationwide credit rating system, authorities across the country are also exploring new ways to crack down on those who do not pay debts.

Anyone who telephones an individual on the blacklist will first be forced to listen to a pre-recorded message saying ?please urge this person to fulfil their legal obligations?.Xinhua said the city of Wuhan has also launched a series of crackdowns on debt defaulters, and detained a total of 186 people in the first half of the year."

This is what several playback singers in present-day Bollywood feel is on their plate. However, Lata Mangeshkar, the ?Nightingale of India? and Bharat Ratna awardee, says that in her days as a young artiste ? this was when the term ?Bollywood?, a derivative of Hollywood, didn?t even exist ? she never saw the need or the opportunity for media attention.Read: Bollywood doesn?t give us due credit: Playback singers voice their discontent?When I began singing, I didn?t even know about the media, or how to get written about. Mujhe toh sirf gana tha (all I had to do was sing). After my father?s untimely death, I was the sole bread-winner of the family. I had no time to think of anything except how to look after my siblings. The only thing I could do was sing. So I sang. I?d leave early in the morning and commute by train(in Mumbai) from studio to studio, meeting music directors hoping to get work,? recalls Lata tai.All that changed in 1947, when the voice of Lata Mangeshkar exploded in India cinema, wiping away all other singing prototypes.The Nightingale recalls those heady days of initial success with sheer gratitude. ?I think in 1949, I sang around 100-120 songs. The majority of them, from films like Mehboob?s Andaz and Raj Kapoor?s Barsaat, were big hits.

But it was Rawat who saved the day for India by scoring a 50 break just when they had a deficit of a similar margin.But a critical miss on the pink before starting with the colours, brought Masih back to the table, gifting him a regulation clearance of yellow to black. Given the kind of pressure that was resting on his shoulders to rescue Pakistan from the brink of defeat, he fumbled on the green and gave Advani an unintended snook.But the Indian ace was in no mood of leaving the table without getting the job done.

These stations are Shalimar Bagh, Netaji Subhash Place, Naraina, Sarojini Nagar, INA, South Extension, Vinoba Puri, Ashram and Hazrat Nizamuddin.Until now, most of the existing artworks are installed at the underground stations.

The aim is to fill most of the interior walls at the concourse levels with paintings and photographs,? a metro official said.On the Magenta Line, the stations have been re-designed where instead of the traditional walls and windows, the concourse and platforms will be made of cemented honeycomb design for enhanced ventilation. ?The station will be covered with jaali-like walls to allow more light and ventilation into the concourse.

"Aadhaar-issuing authority UIDAI has asked the states to ensure that all enrolments, even those by private agencies, shift to government premises from external sites by September this year. The move will affect 25,000 active enrolment centres across India.

Or they may go to a centre and find it closed. At times, there are complaints of overcharging,"" he said adding that tighter control over private agencies will ensure that services are performed strictly as per prescribed norms and there are not deviations.The latest move assumes significance as most government and other services such as benefits, subsidies and services like PAN, GST, bank accounts, passports and property registration now require Aadhaar.Hence, it would be imperative for state governments to provide the facility of enrolments and updates at secure and convenient locations so residents are not inconvenienced.In the letter to all the chief secretaries dated June 28, UIDAI has said that states governments can set up their own enrolment centres within the government or municipal premises with their own personnel as enrolment operators.Alternatively, they can engage UIDAIs empanelled enrolment agencies after reviewing their credentials, provided these centres are set up in government or municipal premises.UIDAI has said at least three centres should be established initially in every block or taluk (within government premises). Thereafter, the number of such centres can be reviewed as per demand.Asked about the implication of the new directive, Pandey said, ""private entrepreneurs will have to find supervised premises or they have to close down business"".The UIDAI is the nodal body responsible for rolling out Aadhaar, the 12-digit biometric identification number, to all residents.

"Too many shops and restaurants at Delhi Airport could hinder evacuations and jeopardise the lives of passengers during an emergency, a parliamentary panel has concluded in a draft report. It said, ""The advice of security agencies is being overlooked for commercial interests."" Delhi International Airport Limited and the Civil Aviation Ministry have ignored the safety concerns, the report claimed.","Summarise: Too many shops and restaurants at New Delhi?s Indira Gandhi international airport could jeopardise lives of passengers during an emergency but the airport operator and the government have ignored these safety concerns, a parliamentary panel has concluded.In a draft report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) saw the commercial establishments as a ?big hindrance? to evacuation plans. CISF handles airport security across the country.HT accessed the draft report that was taken up for adoption at the PAC meeting last week.The committee indicted the operators, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) and the ministry of civil aviation for what it says was the ?unscientific commercial usage? of the space available for passengers, especially restaurants, retail outlets, duty-free complexes and executive lounges. ?The advice of security agencies is being overlooked for commercial interests,? the report said, while also deprecating ?the complicity? of the civil aviation ministry. ?Members of the committee felt that mishap or disaster could be foreseen given the present state of narrow lanes for movement of passengers?. According to the report, CISF director-general OP Singh raised the issues in letters to the civil aviation ministry but got no response. A delegation of 14 PAC members met Singh during a visit to the airport?s two passenger terminals on March 7.The CISF DG did not give a comment for this story. A ministry spokesperson too did not offer any comment on the PAC?s observations.The PAC also noted that it received feedback from air passengers association of India (APAI) that the experience of flyers is ?nightmarish?: services are expensive, lounges and restrooms are dirty, quality of food sub-par, food courts ill-managed, seating facility at lounges not adequate, and baggage handling counters are inconvenient.?The committee was told that though feedback forms are available, no action is taken on these suggestions/complaints. The committee deplores the laxity of MoCA (ministry of civil aviation) for not taking strict action against the operators in this regard.? The Delhi International Airport Private Ltd (DIAL) is a joint venture consortium led by the GMR Group.A DIAL spokesperson said the airport?s terminals were well within global aviation standards in terms of the proportion of area given out to commercial setups with respect to the overall size of the terminal. ?In the last six years, IGI airport has retained a stellar ranking in Airport Service Quality (ASQ). The airport serves as a model to most other airports in India and worldwide on parameters such as passenger amenities, user friendliness, accessibility, cleanliness, security, entertainment, retail offerings and various other aspects,? the spokesperson said. The two terminals, T1 and T3, serve more than 150,000 passengers every day with nearly 1,200 flights arriving or departing.HT has reported that the domestic terminal, T1, currently handles more passengers than it was designed for. The adoption of the report was deferred, according to sources, due to differences of opinion over the demand by a BJP MP that the panel should recommend a CBI inquiry into the alleged violations of the agreement between DIAL and the airport authority of India. The panel also criticised the airport operators for licensing out land around the terminals without making any study about the passenger movement, their accommodation needs and accessibility to the airport ?which is evident from a large number of hotels cropping up in the area and consequent illegal use of the licensed land for other purposes.? The delegation that visited the airport comprised chairman KV Thomas, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab and Congress MP Shantaram Naik, and 10 other parliamentariansThe panel also expressed reservation against the ?unethical? development fee on passengers, saying that they should not be made to pay for airport infrastructure that is the ?sole responsibility? of DIAL and its shareholders."

Speaking after a day of bilateral discussions at the G20 summit in Hamburg, the prime minister said the UK had led on bolstering the global fight against terror and modern slavery as well as pushing for the implementation of the Paris agreement and boosting international trade.On terrorism, Theresa May repeated past calls for world leaders to do more to disrupt international finance streams for terror groups and to help stop foreign fighters returning to the west from conflicts in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. She also said the G20 agreed to do more to combat domestic violent extremism and welcomed moves from technology companies to address the online spread of extremist content.The prime minister went on to describe modern slavery and trafficking as the ?great human rights issue of our time? and highlighted the UK?s taskforce to combat the issue. She said more needed to be done around thew world and called for a ?radically new global approach? to stopping human traffickers. On the Paris Agreement, the most contentious issue of the summit, May said she was ?dismayed? at the US decision to leave the pact. She urged Trump to rejoin it and said, following questions, that she had pushed the US president to do so in conversations during the Hamburg meeting. May went on to say she was a leading advocate of free trade but admitted some had been ?left behind? by globalisation - an admission she has made repeatedly in the past. She said the UK had pushed for G20 leaders to stop steel dumping practices and to do more to economically empower women. The prime minister added that the UK would work with others to improve international trading systems and to ensure more job opportunities for women. Linking her bilateral meetings to the Brexit process, May said she looked forward to agreeing trade deals with ?new friends and old partners?. Asked about a visit from one of the UK?s oldest partners, the US, May said no date had been agreed for Trump?s arrival in London.

Vladimir Putin said he had established a working relationship with US president Donald Trump, speaking at a press conference as the G20 summit draws to a close.The Russian president said thought there were grounds to believe at least partial cooperation with Washington could be achieved. Putin said he felt Trump had accepted Putin?s assertions that Moscow had not interfered in the US presidential election last year, but that it was best to ask Trump what his views on that were. He said the two leaders at their meeting had agreed to work together on cyber security and said he thought Trump in reality was a different person from the one seen on TV.Putin said Trump had asked him detailed questions regarding allegations that Moscow had interfered in last year?s US election. He said he had tried to give Trump detailed answers which he said seemed to satisfy his counterpart.The new ceasefire deal in southern Syria was the result of the United States altering its stance and becoming more pragmatic about the situation there, Putin said.He also said that certain pre-cursors had been created for an improvement in relations between Moscow and Washington going forward.

While climate change could not be agreed on, officials did reach a common statement including Trump about the other contentious issue at the summit, trade. However Merkel said discussions on subject with the US had been particularly difficult. The statement retains the G20?s longstanding rejection of protectionism. But it also acknowledged that trade must be mutually beneficial and that countries can use ?legitimate? trade defenses to protect workers and industries against being taken advantage of by trade partners.Merkel reiterated her statement that Europeans have to take their fate ?in their own hands,? saying that while cooperation with the US is important, some topics like trade, steel in particular, are ?difficult? to discuss with the Americans.

In a press conference, Angela Merkel said world leaders have agreed their final communique at the G20 summit.She said 19 members of the Group of 20 have reaffirmed the Paris climate accord as ?irreversible.?She made clear that it had been very difficult to get a consensus and in the end, breaking from tradition, a separate paragraph was included to cover the position of the US, who are withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement and wanted fossil fuels to be mentioned. The German chancellor said the declaration makes absolutely clear that is not the common position of the other 19 world leaders. Merkel said there had been no compromise on climate change and called the US position ?regrettable?.She said: ?We amended the declaration and it says very clearly what the United States of America want and underneath what the other countries want.?The German chancellor said she ?deplored? the decision by the US to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, but said that all other nations agree Paris climate accord is irreversible.Here is the controversial section of the G20 communique:We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The United States of America announced it will immediately cease the implementation of its current nationally-determined contribution and affirms its strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs. The United States of America states it will endeavour to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and help deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in their nationally determined contributions. Directly following that paragraph is this one, as Merkel said in her press conference:The Leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris Agreement is irreversible. We reiterate the importance of fulfilling the UNFCCC commitment by developed countries in providing means of implementation including financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation actions in line with Paris outcomes and note the OECD?s report ?Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth?. We reaffirm our strong commitment to the Paris Agreement, moving swiftly towards its full implementation in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances and, to this end, we agree to the G20 Hamburg Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth as set out in the Annex.

Trump has promised $639 million in funding for humanitarian programmes, including $331 million to help feed starving people in four famine-hit countries - Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen. The US president?s pledge came during a working session of the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, providing a ?godsend? to the UN World Food Programme, the group?s executive director, David Beasley, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting.?We?re facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two,? said Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by Trump to head the world?s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide. He said the additional funding was about a third of what the agency estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries facing famine and in other areas. The WFP estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst affected zones stemming from wars and ?man-made? crises, Beasley said. ?We estimated that if we didn?t receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months,? he said. Trump?s announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the US State Department and other humanitarian missions as part of his ?America First? policy. Beasley said the agency had worked hard with the White House and the U.S. government to secure the funding, but Trump would insist that other countries contributed more as well. A WPF spokesman said Germany recently pledged an additional 200 million euros for food relief.The United States has long been the largest donor to the WFP."
The International Cricket Council has welcomed BCCI's decision of clearing the Indian cricket team to participate in the upcoming Champions Trophy in England and Wales.

The actor finally opened up in an interview about the posts that made everyone sit up and take notice.Talking to Outlook, Abhay said, ""This may be my first such post on Facebook, but I have tweeted about the issue in the past. I have been making an effort in my own space... Honestly, I was just expressing my views - I did it for awareness, though with a bit of fun... The FB post was a little provocative, to make people think.""He added, ""My appeal is to those in high positions, who have power and lead very comfortable lives. It is not to a struggling actor who is new on the scene, and for whom endorsement of a product (s)he doesn't perhaps believe in fetches money. There should be a tacit code or understanding among privileged people not to endorse things that give others an inferiority complex.""Abhay's posts targetted some of the most powerful names in Bollywood, but he did get some support for his cause.

"At least 10 people, including an election candidate, were killed on Sunday in violent protests which erupted as the country voted for a new legislative body tasked with rewriting the Constitution. The country's opposition parties boycotted the vote, which they say is aimed at consolidating President Nicolas Maduro's power and is a bid to install a dictatorship.","Summarise: A wave of bloodshed swept Venezuela on Sunday as troops cracked down on violent protests against elections to choose the members of a powerful assembly that President Nicolas Maduro has tasked with writing a new constitution.Protesters attacked polling stations and barricaded streets around the country, drawing a bloody response from security forces, who opened fire with live ammunition in some cases.At least 10 people were killed, prompting the United States to threaten further ?strong and swift? sanctions on Maduro?s government.Senior opposition leader Henrique Capriles called on Venezuelans to continue defying the deeply unpopular Maduro with new protests against the election and the ?massacre? he said accompanied it.?We do not recognize this fraudulent process,? he said at the close of voting, calling for nationwide marches Monday and a mass protest in Caracas Wednesday, the day the new ?Constituent Assembly? is due to be installed.Maduro has decreed a ban on protests during and after the vote, threatening prison terms of up to 10 years.The socialist president is gambling his four-year rule on the 545-member assembly, which will be empowered to dissolve the opposition-controlled congress and rewrite the constitution.But the unrest fueled fears that his insistence on convening the assembly -- despite months of demonstrations and fierce international criticism -- would only plunge the country deeper into chaos.Ten deadProsecutors said 10 people were killed in violence around the vote, bringing the death toll in four months of protests to some 120 people.Those killed included a candidate for the new assembly, a regional opposition leader, two teenage protesters and a soldier in the western state of Tachira, which saw some of the worst violence.In eastern Caracas, seven police were wounded when an improvised explosive targeted their motorcycle convoy.National guard troops used armored vehicles, rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters blocking roads in the west of the capital.Soldiers also violently moved against protesters in the second city of Maracaibo, in the west, and Puerto Ordaz in the east.The opposition had called for a boycott and mass demonstrations against the election, which it condemned as a bid to install a dictatorship.?This constituent assembly is being born in a bloodbath. It is born illegitimate,? said Nicmer Evans, a prominent socialist turned Maduro critic, alleging widespread irregularities.Maduro vote glitchMaduro kicked off voting by casting his ballot in a west Caracas polling station.?I?m the first voter in the country. I ask God for his blessings so the people can freely exercise their democratic right to vote,? he said. He was accompanied by his wife, Cilia Flores, a candidate for the new assembly.He got a technological snub when he scanned his ID card at the polling station and the screen spit out the words, ?This person does not exist or the ID was canceled.?Maduro, whose term is meant to end in 2019, describes the election as the most important in Venezuelan history.?I have come to vote to tell the gringos and the opposition that we want peace, not war, and that we support Maduro,? said voter Ana Contreras.Turnout will be key to determining the legitimacy of the election.But that will be difficult to ascertain, as most voters will be able to vote twice: once by region and once by social or industrial sector.According to polling firm Datanalisis, more than 70 percent of Venezuelans oppose the idea of the new assembly -- and 80 percent reject Maduro?s leadership.?The people are not going to give up the streets until this awful government goes,? protester Carlos Zambrano, 54, told AFP in western Caracas.Venezuelans also protested in Miami, Madrid and various Latin American cities.The number of Venezuelans living abroad has soared as the once-booming oil producer has descended into a devastating economic crisis marked by shortages, runaway inflation, riots and looting.US sanctionsFear of the violence worsening has rippled across the region, and beyond. The US, the EU, Canada and Latin American powers including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have condemned the election.?Maduro?s sham election is another step toward dictatorship,? tweeted US envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley.Britain?s junior foreign minister Alan Duncan also described the vote as a ?sham,? as did many experts.?The vote means the end of any trace of democratic rule. Maduro?s blatant power grab removes any ambiguity about whether Venezuela is a democracy,? said Michael Shifter, head of the Inter-American Dialogue research center.Several foreign airlines, including Air France, Delta, Avianca and Iberia have suspended flights to Venezuela over security concerns.The US has ordered the families of its diplomats to leave after imposing sanctions on 13 current and former Venezuelan officials.It threatened further sanctions against Caracas.?We will continue to take strong and swift actions against the architects of authoritarianism in Venezuela, including those who participate in the National Constituent Assembly as a result of today?s flawed election,?

"Enforcement agencies recently discovered that genitals of big monitor lizards were being smuggled and sold as ""lucky charm"" for better sex life and fertility in men. Madhya Pradesh Special Task Force busted the racket in Indore and Khargone arresting three traders and a priest. They seized 68 pieces of the body part, some of which were smeared with vermillion.","Summarise: There is a new entry in the bizarre world of illegal wildlife trade in India. Enforcement agencies have discovered that now the big monitor lizard (genus Varanus) - found across deserts, forests and coastlines of the country - is being poached for its hemipenis (sexual organ), which is sold as a lucky charm for virility and fertility in men. Because of its forked appearance, it is called ""hatha jodi"". This is often used to confuse customers with the popular Ayurvedic plant ""hath jod"", which serves to mend bone fractures. The Madhya Pradesh special task Force (MPSTF) seized 68 pieces of the tiny reptile body part from four poachers in raids in Indore and Khargone from June 16-17. One of those arrested was a priest of the famous Navagraha temple of Khargone, who was found in possession of 13 hatha jodi. ""This also points towards the artificially created religious beliefs around hatha jodi,"" said RP Singh, additional principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) of MP. Many pieces have been found smeared with vermillion around temples in the past few days. Three traders - Sumit Sharma, Sachin Sharma and Feroze Ali - were nabbed from Indore with 10 pieces of the contraband. Lokesh Jagirdar, the Navagraha temple priest, was also arrested on June 16. On Saturday, following clues given by them, their supplier, Rajesh Porwal, was taken into custody from Indore. Officers said the items were most probably procured from western MP or the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, where the stony and desert topography harbours large populations of the lizard. Each piece was being sold for anywhere between Rs 500 to Rs 15,000 depending on how naive or desperate the buyer is. ""So many false pretexts are given, ranging from boosted sex life to success in lucky draws and gambling and prosperity in business. Unfortunately, with increasing prosperity in towns like Ujjain, Indore and Ratlam, people are willing to shell out the money as well,"" Singh said.SEX SELLS AND SO DO GENITALSDr Sumit Dookia, herpetologist and professor at Delhi's Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, said, ""India has four varieties of these reptiles - Bengal, Yellow, Desert and Water Monitor Lizard. Their habitat is distributed across the middle Himalayas to Western Ghats. They are expert terrestrial animals as well as great swimmers."" ""Notably, they serve an important role in the ecosystem as scavengers, eating up the flesh of dead animals alongside eggs, insects, small birds and animals. Any downfall in their numbers is unhealthy for the ecosystem,"" he added. They are a Schedule 1 species as per India's Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) prohibits trade in the Bengal Monitor Lizard. Additional Director of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Tilottama Verma, informed, ""Previously, we had found 210 hatha jodis in Brahmeswarpatna area of Odisha on May 30. And 22 such pieces were confiscated in Hyderabad in March, taking the confirmed number of big lizards killed for their genitals to 300 at least. Some such items were seized in Chennai too."" ""We have long known monitor lizards to be killed sporadically for their meat, fat and oil, consumed in mostly some tribal areas. But hatha jodis certainly came as a surprise to us. We sent them to various scientific labs to ascertain their true origin,"" he added. The items are also being sold online, even on big global e-tail firms. ""We had launched Operation Wildnet to get hold of such unscrupulous elements a few months back, which has so far been successful.

Tom DartThe Guardian?s Tom Dart reports from Bellville, Texas:Business was brisk in the Trump Cafe, a Donald-themed diner in the small Texas town of Bellville, an hour?s drive from Houston. Patrons cheered the president?s inauguration and clapped during moments in his speech when patriotism and promises united in rhetorical embrace. Larry Reed sat at the entrance behind a table selling hats, flasks, wristbands and Trump badges with the slogan ?Make America Great Again, President, Commander in Chief, Tweet Softly - But Carry A Big Stick.??I think that we?ve needed change in this country for a long, long time, and that?s why he got elected,? the 72-year-old said. ?Middle America, everything other than a couple of coastal areas has been crying out for change and neither party has given it. And it?s time. And so they took someone with a little populism and said ?hey, you know what? He doesn?t have to be perfect. If he claims to do these things, and he does it, we?re going to be happy?.?Reed does not think electing Trump is risky. ?No president can bring this country down, okay? Every president has had flaws, deep flaws, every one of them. They?re just men. But if they will lead, if they will put the right people in place to implement things that we need to see, we?ll be fine. We always are, no matter who the president is, and that?s what everyone has to realise this year. We?re going to be just fine if everybody will just zip their lips and watch it happen.?

Here?s the text of Trump?s inauguration speech, as prepared for delivery:Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.Today?s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another ? but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.For too long, a small group in our nation?s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.Washington flourished ? but the people did not share in its wealth.Politicians prospered ? but the jobs left, and the factories closed.The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation?s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes ? starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration.And this, the United States of America, is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.Everyone is listening to you now.You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation ? and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.For many decades, we?ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;We?ve defended other nation?s borders while refusing to defend our own;And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America?s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We?ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.From this moment on, it?s going to be America First.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.I will fight for you with every breath in my body ? and I will never, ever let you down.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work ? rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world ? but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones ? and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.The Bible tells us, ?how good and pleasant it is when God?s people live together in unity.?We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.There should be no fear ? we are protected, and we will always be protected.We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ? constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is over.Now arrives the hour of action.Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:You will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.

"The Gujarat government has decided to celebrate the 'World Heritage City' status granted to Ahmedabad by UNESCO for a fortnight. The programme, starting on August 1, will include heritage walks, cultural events, lectures and seminars about the 600-year-old city. Further, all flights to Gujarat will serve Gujarati cuisine to passengers during the 2-week-long celebration.","Summarise: The BJP-led Gujarat government is going all out to celebrate the world heritage city status accorded to Ahmedabad by UNESCO earlier this month with an eye on assembly elections later this year. The fortnight-long celebrations will start from August 1, aiming to give a boost to the city?s image through people?s participation. As part of the gala event, the state government in association with central ministries has chalked out elaborate programmes for a two-week-long festival, which includes heritage walk, cultural events, lectures and seminars to showcase the over 600-year-old city founded by emperor Ahmed Shah. During the fortnight, all flights bound for the state will serve a variety of Gujarati cuisines to passengers. ?The idea is to involve people from all walks of life in the celebrations that will be organised across the city. It is a big boost for the city to be given the world heritage status,? said a state government official. The elaborate programmes also aimed at highlighting the heritage-tag for the Ahmedabad as a major success story of the BJP government in the state. The celebrations will coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s visit to his home  state on August 12 to inaugurate the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada. Chief ministers of 12 states ruled by BJP and its allies are expected to attend the event.Ahmedabad is the first Indian city to get the coveted heritage status. Earlier Delhi and Mumbai had also tried to get the tag but failed to make the cut. Gujarat had sent its proposal to UNESCO way back in 2010 when Modi was the CM of the state.A detailed presentation on how the city plans to celebrate the ?world heritage city? status was made by Ahmedabad municipal commissioner at then housing and urban affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu?s residence on Monday. This was the last assignment of Naidu before he demitted office after being named the NDA?s vice president candidate.Also present in the meeting were Union textiles minister Smriti Irani and civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapati Raju. Secretaries of six central ministries, including culture, housing and urban affairs, civil aviation were also in attendance.Besides thematic cultural programmes at historical monuments such as the Bhadra fort, a festival of Gujarati classical films, heritage sadhbhavna yatra, cultural programme at the river front, laser and fire cracker show have also been lined up. The fortnight-long event will also see the launch of a hop-on-hop-off heritage bus tour and special merchandize and souvenirs, depicting various facets of the heritage city."
"Insurance giant Swiss Re is preparing an insurance policy for the Mesoamerican Reef in Mexico to prevent its further deterioration, reports said. Under the scheme, which is reportedly the first for a natural structure, the premiums will be paid by hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.n","Summarise: A stretch of coral reef off Mexico is the testing ground for a new idea that could protect fragile environments around the world: insurance.The reef, off the coast of CancÃºn, is the first to be protected under an insurance scheme by which the premiums will be paid by local hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.Coral reefs offer a valuable buffer against storm damage from waves but their condition has deteriorated in recent years, the result of human exploitation and destruction of the reefs, as well as climate change, plastic waste and the acidification of the oceans.Under the CancÃºn insurance policy, pioneered by the insurance company Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, a US environmental charity, local organisations dependent on tourism will pay in to a collective pot likely to amount to between $1m (Â£770,000) and $7.5m for the insurance premiums on the policy, and a 40 mile (60km) stretch of reef and connected beach will be monitored. If any destructive storms damage the reef system, the insurer will pay out sums likely to be $25m to $70m in any given year.Any payouts will be used for restoration of the reef, for instance by building artificial structures that can increase the height of the reef in case of storm damage.Corals from the reef can be removed and rested for a period of weeks or months, to help them regrow, at which point they can be safely reattached to their native habitat to regenerate the growth of the reef system. The advantages of such restoration go far beyond the hotels that border the seafront. As well as providing a natural brake against destructive storms, coral reefs provide nurseries for fish when they are growing, and form a vital part of the marine ecosystem. Their health or decline is seen as one of the key indicators of the state of the natural environment globally.The CancÃºn scheme, which is to be run by Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, with backing from the Mexican government, is thought to be one of the first in the world to tie environmental benefits and the ?eco-system services? provided by natural environmental features to firm monetary costs and rewards. It could provide a model for similar projects in the future, linking the protection and preservation of the environment to payouts in case of disaster.Hotels and private companies are signing up to the scheme at present, and the plan is for a fund backed by the government that will cover the premiums. This is scheduled to be activated in September, with further contracts to be signed in November and December, and full coverage will then begin from next January.?Public-private partnerships are the key,? said Mark Tercek, chief executive of the Nature Conservancy, in an interview with the Guardian. He predicted that more governments would see the advantages of such an approach when the CancÃºn scheme begins formal operation.?I used to get very frustrated that not enough was happening [to protect the environment],? said Tercek. ?We have to push business leaders to go further, to stick their neck out to tackle issues beyond the short term.?Tercek said the CancÃºn scheme would provide an example for businesses, governments and insurance firms that would be ?very scalable around the world?.A future target for similar insurance products could be mangrove swamps, which also protect the shore against storm damage, and are equally under threat, with many destroyed to make way for housing development or farming, and others in peril from climate change."
"Mexican photographer Sergio Tapiro Velasco, who captured the explosion of a volcano with lightning connecting the ash cloud and volcano surface in 2015, has been named National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year 2017. The friction in the ash particles generated a lightning bolt about 600 metres long between the ash and the volcano, Velasco described.","Summarise: It could easily be mistaken as a CGI photo, given the stunning improbability of capturing a lightning bolt striking an angry, erupting volcano. But that?s precisely what earned a Mexican photographer the title of 2017 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. Selected from more than 15,000 entries from participants in more than 30 countries, the photograph by Sergio Tapiro Valesco captures volcanic lightning -- also known as a dirty thunderstorm -- whereby a flash of lightning is produced within the ash cloud spewing from the volcano. Titled ?The Power of Nature,? the photo was taken 12 km away from the crater of the active volcano on a clear night. Glowing, angry lava, plumes of grey smoke and lightning bolts are set against a starlit night sky, producing visual testimony of nature?s brute force. For more than a decade, Velasco has been studying and photographing Mexico?s Colima volcano, also known as the ?Volcano of Fire.?  He had been tracking the increase in activity and closely monitoring the volcano for almost a month, and positioned himself for the shoot, during which he heard an explosive booming noise. ?When I looked on the camera display, all I could do was stare,? Velasco said.  ?What I was watching was impossible to conceive, the image showed those amazing forces of nature interacting on a volcano, while the lightning brightened the whole scene. It?s an impossible photograph and my once in a lifetime shot that shows the power of nature.? Follow @htlifeandstyle for more. "
The annual media trip to Tibet organised by China for journalists from its neighbouring countries has been cancelled for five Indian journalists amid the India-China stand-off. No official reason was given by Chinese embassy officials. Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondents Convenor Vijay Naik said the Chinese may be waiting for a conducive atmosphere to resume the media programme.,"Summarise: China has called off the annual media trip that it organises for journalists to travel to Tibet. Following the recent border stand-off between Chinese and Indian troops, the tour of five Indian and as many Nepalese journalists has been cancelled.No official reason was given by the embassy officials to the journalists. One of the participants, Vijay Naik, Convenor of Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondents said, ""The invite was received but because the tensions have increased the Chinese may have thought of letting things cool down and let the atmosphere become conducive again for the media programme to resume. But, we have no official communication explaining the reason for the cancellation.""The trip was to commence from July 8 and end on July 15. It was only on Saturday that the participants were informed of the cancellation when they were all set for the journey. Speaking to India Today Agni Roy, Senior Editor with Ananda Bazaar Patrika said, ""We all were waiting to go to Tibet. My passport is still deposited in the Chinese embassy as I was supposed to get my visa on Monday. It is really disappointing"".The Chinese embassy organises these annual trips to Tibet with journalists from the region. This last minute cancellation many believe is the direct result of the border tensions at the tri-junction where India (in Sikkim), China and Bhutan meet."
"A Delhi court has ordered an FIR against a policewoman for allegedly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl, who had earlier accused her teacher of molesting her. The court said that false evidence was being created by policewoman solely to accord benefit to the accused teacher. The cop allegedly got the girl medically examined without her consent.","Summarise: A Delhi court has ordered an FIR against a woman police officer for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor girl, who had earlier accused her teacher of molesting her. The Delhi Police, however, said they will begin internal probe in the matter and challenge the order in high court if the charges were found to be false.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, on Monday, passed the order after the 13-year-old girl told the court that she was sexually assaulted by the woman investigating officer (IO) of the case and she had lodged a complaint with the police against her but no action was taken.The court also dismissed the third bail plea of the teacher of a government school, facing prosecution in the case, saying there was no change in circumstances.?Today, separate directions have been given for lodging of FIR against the IO in this case for having committed penetrative sexual assault upon the child victim and creating false evidence.?Needless to say, false evidence was being created by the IO solely to accord benefit thereof to the applicant/accused Manoj Rathi (teacher). Be that as it may, I do not find any change in the circumstance warranting taking different view. The bail application of the applicant accordingly stands dismissed,? the judge said.The court directed the SHO of Mangolpuri in north west Delhi to get the FIR registered against woman IO, a sub-inspector, through a senior officer and file a status report in the matter on April 29.Senior police officers, however, said that they were yet to receive a copy of the court order. They said the court?s order will be examined by their legal department. ?We will defend the woman investigating officer if the charges against her are found baseless. For this, we will challenge the city court?s order in the high court. But if the charges are found true, we will certainly register a case against the woman officer and take strictest possible action under law,? the officer said. The officer said that the court has asked them to file the status report on February 29. ?We still have 10 days to complete our internal enquiry, take legal opinion and decide our further course of action,? the officer said.The girl, in her complaint, alleged that the IO had threatened her father to get the victim medically re-examined or she would implicate her in a false case.The child alleged that initially the woman official sexually assaulted her and later took her to a hospital where the doctors conducted her internal medical examination without her consent.The police which is already probing the aspect of sexual assault on the minor by her teacher, had earlier informed the court that it has also registered an FIR against the girl?s father in view of the alleged confession letter which was given to the police by the school staff.The school staff had given to police an alleged confession letter of the girl?s father that he had repeatedly sexually assaulted her.The initial incident occurred in August last year when the girl, a Class V student of a government school in Aman Vihar area of North-West Delhi, asked a question to the teacher who told her to meet him alone later.The girl said in her complaint that the teacher allegedly molested her and when her parents came to the school next day to complain about his conduct, he threatened them and took thumb impression of the child?s father on a blank paper.The teacher then allegedly wrote a confession letter on behalf of the girl?s father that he had repeatedly sexually assaulted his daughter and got the signatures of other colleagues, she had alleged. Later, a case under the POCSO Act was registered by the police against the accused teacher.The police have also lodged a case against other school teachers and principal for not informing them about an alleged confession letter of a minor girl?s father.(With PTI inputs)"

The jetliners will be used as the new Air Force One and its backup. Air Force One is the aircraft that carries the President of the United States. ","Summarise: Facing pressure from President Donald Trump to cut the cost of new Air Force One aircraft, the US Air Force is negotiating with Boeing to purchase two 747-8 jetliners that were built for a Russian airline that went bankrupt before they were delivered.?We?re working through the final stages of coordination to purchase two commercial 747-8 aircraft and expect to award a contract soon,? said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek, who declined to elaborate on the details.National security publication Defense One, which first reported the negotiations, said the Air Force was believed to be getting a good deal on the aircraft, which sell for about $386 million on average.The two aircraft were initially ordered four years ago by Transaero, a Russian airline that went bankrupt in 2015, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters.Boeing built two 747-8s out of an order of four. But the airline never took ownership of them, and the planes have been stored in the Mojave Desert, where the dry, hot climate slows corrosion, Defense One said.Trump rattled Boeing in December before taking office by saying in a Twitter message: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called Trump and told him the cost could be reduced if the Air Force changed its requirements, sources familiar with the conversation said at the time.White House officials in December were unclear where Trump obtained the $4 billion figure. The Air Force has estimated it would spend $2.87 billion through 2021 for development of a new presidential aircraft. The cost of refitting the commercial 747-8s with the enhanced electronics and security systems required for Air Force One were unclear.Boeing had said it expected to add the Air Force One jets to its backlog, which currently numbers 20 planes - five passenger models and 15 freighters.The redeployment to the Air Force of jets already built for another customer would effectively reduce Boeing?s future 747 production plans by two aircraft. But it would provide a home for two airframes that have been built but remain unsold.The Air Force operates two military versions of the Boeing 747-200B aircraft that serve as Air Force One when the president is aboard. Both are nearing the end of their planned 30-year life. "

The film, a cinematic adaptation of MT Vasudevan's book Randamoozham, is reportedly going to be made on a budget of Rs 1000 crore, the highest for any Indian film so far. Even before the film has gone on floors, it has run into trouble.Kerala Hindu Aikya Vedi president KP Sasikala has threatened to stall the release of the film unless the name is changed, according to a report in The News Minute. ""A big budget film is coming from Kerala named Mahabharatham. We are happy but the Hindus here have a condition - only a film which is close to the story of real Mahabharatham written by Vyasan should carry its name. No other movie can be named Mahabharatham. If the movie is based on Randamoozham let the name of the film also be named same. Veda Vyasan also has his rights,"" she said.To support her argument, Sasikala said that Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is another version of the Bible. However, the makers of the film did not use the title 'Bible' and the makers of Mohanlal's film should follow their example."
"AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala's husband M Natarajan on Monday accused the BJP of trying to destabilise the Tamil Nadu government. ""There are also attempts to saffronise Tamil Nadu but they will not succeed. I will tour the entire state and tear their mask,"" he said. ""I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere,"" he added.","Summarise: Thanjavur, Jan 16 (PTI) M Natarajan, husband of AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala, tonight accused ""some sections"" in the BJP of trying to split the AIADMK and get the state government dismissed. ""They are trying to break the AIADMK and dismiss our government. They are trying to besmirch our government. There are also attempts to saffronise Tamil Nadu but they will not succeed. I will tour the entire state and tear their mask,"" he said. ""We will not allow such conspiracies to succeed...I will face the challenge squarely...I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere,"" he said while addressing the valedictory session of the three-day Thamizhar Kalai Ilakkiya Pongal Thiruvizha (Tamil art and literary Pongal festival) here. The remarks of Natarajan are significant because he is said to wield considerable influence in the AIADMK, particularly after the demise of J Jayalalithaa, and his allegation against the BJP comes against the souring relations between the two parties. Later when asked by reporters about the attempts to divide the party and dismiss the government, Natarajan said definitely attempts were on at the behest of S Gurumurthy, the RSS ideologue. Significantly, Gurumurthy, who has taken over as Editor of Thuglaq magazine after the demise of founder-editor Cho S Ramaswamy, had made veiled remarks at the annual readers interaction on Saturday in Chennai that while one party was already under the control of a family (apparent reference to DMK), another party was going into the control of a family (AIADMK). Natarajan dared Gurumurthy to come out ""in the open"" and oppose them and ""not hide behind"". He also questioned the security being given to Gurumurthy who held no position in the government. He said while they support Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there were others who were creating problem for the AIADMK. Natarajan said when powerful forces were acting against Jayalalithaa after MGRs death, it was he and his family who had protected her like a shield. ""There were just four or five of us who protected her...for 36 years since then, my wife Sasikala was bearing her on her shoulders,"" Natarajan said delving on the hard sacrifices that he and his family had made to protect Jayalalithaa and thereby preserve the AIADMK from the designs of the rival DMK. He said unnecessary controversies and questions were being raised over Jayalalithaas treatment in the hospital. Her entire treatment has been recorded. She was with a clear mind while in the hospital, he claimed. Complimenting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam of giving able administration, Natarajan said it was his personal opinion that he should continue as CM. "

This amount was same as drawn by his predecessor Raghuram Rajan in August that year.Rajan assumed RBI governorship from September 5, 2013 at a monthly salary of Rs 1.69 lakh.

"A 14-year-old Mumbai boy killed himself on Saturday after jumping off the terrace of a seven-storey building. Police suspect that the boy was addicted to the online game 'Blue Whale' which demands players to complete 50 tasks in 50 days, with the last task being committing suicide. However, the police is officially yet to find the reason for his suicide.","Summarise: A 14-year-old boy in Andheri, a suburb of Mumbai, killed himself this weekend, jumping off the terrace of his seven-floor building on Saturday. Sources within the Mumbai Police tell India Today that the boy is believed to have been addicted to an online game known as 'Blue Whale'. Blue Whale is a challenge-based underground game with a shadowy history, and has previously been linked to suicides in Russia and other countries. However, officially, Mumbai Police has said that it is yet to find the reason behind the 14-year-old Andheri boy's suicide.The boy, a 9th standard student of an international school in Andheri, is survived by his parents and two sisters. He dreamed of becoming a pilot and had expressed a desire to go to Russia for training.Â On Saturday, a neighbour from a building adjoining the boy's spotted the teenager on the terrace, walking on parapet while shooting what seemed to be a selfie video. The boy then jumped off and killed himself.Â  The Mumbai Police have registered an accidental death report (ADR) in the matter and have ruled it to be a clear case of suicide.Cops, however, refused to confirm whether the suicide was linked to Blue Whale. Speaking to India Today, DCP Navinchandra Reddy said, ""The parents have not given any information on the reason of suicide, they are in state of shock. We are investigating the case in all possible angles (sic).""BLUE WHALEBlue Whale is a video game said to have originated in Russia and its creator was reportedly arrested by Russian police earlier this year. The game gives players a series of 50 quests, with the final task asking them to commit suicide. The game also asks players to document the completion of each task in the form of photographs. The players are supposed to send the evidence of their completion to the game's administrator who then qualifies them to attempt the next task. Blue Whale's tasks range from the seemingly harmless - watching a scary video at 4 am - to the disturbing - writing/drawing on arms with a sharp object.For the final task, players are directed to jump off a terrace building while, again, documenting the act in the form of photos/video. Â According to media reports, Blue Whale has spread across several countries and taken lives of hundreds of teenagers. However, the Andheri suicide would likely be the first such case in India.Following the suicide, a WhatsApp message warning parents about Blue Whale has begun to do the rounds in Mumbai. The message, seen by India Today, references the Andheri suicide to say that parents should be wary of handing their children mobile phones or other devices that could allow them to access the online challenge."

"Premier League club Manchester City has signed French side AS Monaco's Benjamin Mendy for Â£52 million (over ?436 crore), making him the world's most expensive defender. The 23-year-old left-back surpassed Kyle Walker, who recently signed for Manchester City from Tottenham Hotspur for over Â£45 million (around ?377 crore). Manchester City has now taken its summer spending to over Â£200 million.","Summarise: Manchester City have taken their summer spending to more than Â£200m with the signing of Benjamin Mendy from Monaco and increased their total outlay in the transfer market since Pep Guardiola took charge 13 months ago to Â£385m.The transfer fee of Â£52m (?57.5m) for Mendy is a world record for a defender and is Guardiola?s latest signal of intent as he seeks to build a squad capable of winning major silverware in his second season at the Etihad Stadium.City?s spending is closing in on Real Madrid?s record for money outlayed in a single transfer window by one club, set when the Spanish club spent ?257m (Â£230m) in the summer of 2009 bringing in Xabi Alonso, Karim Benzema, KakÃ¡ and Cristiano Ronaldo.Mendy, who has signed a five-year contract with City, had been identified as a key target by Guardiola following the departure of the left-back GaÃ«l Clichy at the end of last season and Aleksandar Kolarov, who left for Roma last week after seven years at the club. His signing completes a transformation of City?s defence since Guardiola?s appointment last summer.City confirmed over the weekend the Â£26.5m switch from Real Madrid of Danilo, who is expected to provide cover for the first-choice full-backs Mendy and the Â£45m signing from Tottenham Hotspur, Kyle Walker. They will line up alongside other expensive arrivals including the centre-back John Stones, signed last season for Â£47m, and the Â£34.9m goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica.The signing of Mendy, in particular, is a statement not only of City?s financial firepower but also of Guardiola?s determination to build the kind of ruthless attacking machine which he developed at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.Mendy, 23, came through Le Havre?s youth system before a move to Marseille in 2013. He switched to Monaco last summer for Â£11m where he established himself as one of the best full-backs in the world with his powerful and direct style of play as the club claimed the French title and reached the Champions League semi-finals.Like Walker, Mendy is at his most effective going forward and City will hope the duo can add a surge of energy in wide areas that was lacking last season; Guardiola received some criticism for switching between four and three at the back and deploying his full-backs in unfamiliar roles tucked into midfield. City?s new recruits indicate a move towards a more typical and consistent four-man defence, although Mendy and Walker are comfortable at wing-back.Mendy will join City?s squad in Los Angeles where Guardiola?s side are preparing to face Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup .?I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester City,? Mendy said. ?They are one of Europe?s leading clubs and in Pep Guardiola they have a manager committed to playing attacking football. I am sure that over the next few years we will be successful.?Txiki Begiristain, City?s director of football, said: ?Benjamin has all the qualities we are looking for in a full-back. For such a young player he has a wealth of top-level experience. He is undoubtedly one of the world?s best full-backs, our No1 target in this position. We are all delighted to have him here at Manchester City.?"

Jaitley had filed a case after Kejriwal's lawyer Ram Jethmalani called him a 'crook' in court, during the previous case's hearing.","Summarise: In a major set back for Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi High Court has imposed on him a fine ofÂ  Rs 10,000 for not filing a response on the fresh Rs 10 crore defamation suit against him by Union minister Arun Jaitley. The joint registrar Pankaj Gupta directed Kejriwal to deposit the cost while granting him two more weeks to file his response. The high court had on May 23 sought the response of Kejriwal on why defamation proceedings should not be initiated against him. OBJECTIONABLE TERMDuring the cross-examination of Jaitley on May 17, Arvind Kejriwal's former counsel Ram Jethmalani had allegedly used a term Jaitley had found objectionable. A day after, another high court judge, who was hearing a connected matter, had termed as scandalous the remarks made by Jethmalani against Jaitley.Terming the word as not only false, baseless, malicious and abusive, but per se defamatory, Jaitley had told the court he was subjected to numerous questions, terminologies/statements that are ex-facie abusive, malicious, offensive, irrelevant and slanderous. At the same time, while hearing Jaitley's another application to expedite the proceedings of the defamation suit, the court directed Kejriwal not to put ""scandalous"" questions to Jaitley. Holding that the remarks by Jethmalani, who has now quit as Kejriwal's counsel, were indecent, the court sought undertakings from Kejriwal's new counsel, who would cross-examine Jaitley. ""I have never seen such scandalous words being used in any suit and it is uncalled for. This is not the way to conduct the cross-examination, they have to control themselves. You have used some words. Do these fall under free speech? Are you aware that these are unparliamentary words?"" the judge said. Justice Manmohan said the chief minister should conduct cross-examination of the senior BJP leader in a dignified manner and in accordance with law. The court added that liberty of free expression could not be confused with the license to make unfounded, unwarranted and irresponsible aspersions. Observing that such words were prohibited under the Evidence Act, the court said if there was even an iota of scandalous questions in future cross-examination, it would transfer the case from the joint registrar to a bench of the high court. DEFAMATION SUITThe AAP leaders had accused the BJP leader of corruption as the president of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), a post he had held from 2000 to 2013. Jaitley, who had rejected all allegations levelled by the AAP leaders in December 2015, filed a civil defamation suit seeking Rs 10 crore in damages from Kejriwal and five other others, claiming they made false and defamatory statements in the case involving DDCA, thereby harming his reputation. The AAP leaders had allegedly attacked Jaitley and some of his family members on social media platforms, over alleged irregularities and financial bungling in the DDCA."

At the store in Kharagpur, face towels were kept in a room with broken windows susceptible to damage due to seepage of rainwater.In some zonal railways, new stock remained unutilised almost all their life span.In North Eastern Railway, the audit said, the stock at the depots had already completed two-to-seven months life from the date of manufacture before it was received at the Gorakhpur depot.In the South Eastern Railway, bedsheets (life cycle of 12 months) and pillow covers (life cycle of nine months) remained unutilised for seven months and similarly face towels (life cycle of nine months) remained unutilised for five months at the depots.?This indicated that lot received first were not issued first,? the audit said.In case of pillows too, instructions were not followed, it said.?Blankets and pillows were not dry cleaned and/or sanitised for long periods before supply to the passengers,? the audit said.The audit report also recommended that railways seek regular feedback from passengers to effectively improve passenger satisfaction in respect of quality of linen.

The app reads math questions - even handwritten ones - and gives students step-by-step solutions and explanations that teach them the underlying concepts and help answer all types of math problems. To build the app, the team looked through countless math questions asked by students and categorised them by the steps required to solve them. Then, they wrote high quality Explainers to teach these concepts and tested them with hundreds of high school students. In parallel, the engineering team built algorithms that allow a computer to solve math problems step-by-step. They incorporated data collected from students so that steps closely match those a great teacher or tutor would provide to a student. "

It then takes us to a fictitious village in Delhi-Haryana border area, Mubipura, where people are gearing up for a wedding. Suddenly, cops reach the place looking for men to be sterilized. When the men try to hide, the cops hunt them down and drag them even as a 70-year-old and a 13-year-old male ask policemen to consider the futility of including them in the government-ordered drive. Indu Sarkar soon moves to the central character, Indu (Kriti) - an orphan who wants to become a poet but is told she must only dream to become a good wife and make a family. Following the advice, she marries Navin Sarkar (Tota Roy Chowdhury) who dreams of money, power and fame, while Indu?s dream is only to be a good wife. For almost half of the fiIm, Indu Sarkar remains the story of a docile, humble and meek orphan who surrenders to every whims and fancies of her husband even as she fights her own stammering and a lack of confidence.How this rather ?homely? woman stumbles upon victims of a police raid in a slum, decides to fight for them and eventually becomes one of the most powerful voices of dissent during the Emergency, form the rest of the narrative.Neil Nitin Mukesh in a still from the film.While the film was publicised as a film ?on Emergency?, it actually oscillates between a political drama and a typical Bollywood film about a couple. Unfortunately, the transition between the two narratives is neither smooth nor convincing.One of the saddest moments in the movie comes when Indu, after she has left her husband?s house for the sake of a couple of lost orphan kids, decides to sign the divorce papers Navin sends. When asked why she agreed for the divorce, she says, ?Saath reh kar acchi biwi nahi ban payi, ho sakta hai alag ho kar sukh de paun. (I could not be a good wife, maybe I can give him some comfort by staying away).? As if, all the protest and fight for freedom from a dictatorial government was nothing but a tool to pacify the husband.The background score of Indu Sarkar is too loud and misplaced. At times when a rather emotional moment is approaching, what you hear is the loud melodramatic sound usually used in Bollywood suspense dramas. Anupam Kher in a in a still from the film.Despite having gathered a group of critically appreciated actors, Madhur Bhandarkar fails to make the best use of them. Neil Nitin Mukesh is one of the most wasted talents in the movie. He has given some of his best performances as a mean, high-on-power person but his act as ?chief? in Indu Sarkar appears too superficial. Anupam Kher and Kriti Kulhari take the lead in acting department and stay true to their characters for most of the part. The supporting casts including Sheeba Chaddha, Ankur Vikal and Zakir Hussain, among others appear genuine in their roles.Neil Nitin Mukesh in a still from the film.However, the over-dramatic tone of the film kills their performances and leaves us with dialogues like ?Ek goli ne mere jawan, 6 foot ke bete ko 6 inch ki tasveer bana diya.?Trying to find logic in Indu Sarkar often becomes a task. For example, why does Indu keep roaming around in a rickshaw/auto in the Turkman Gate area every time she needs to witness an eye-opener about the Emergency when she is otherwise driven around in her husband?s car? Or, for that matter, why do the protesters (led by Anupam Kher as ?Nanaji?) keep naming each other when they meet inside a cinema hall to avoid getting caught by the cops? Isn?t the entire purpose of disguise defeated if they use the real names? What is the reason, do you ask? Well, Bollywood is the only word that comes to our mind.Kriti Kulhari in a still from the film.For those interested in the politics of films, there are two ways to look at Madhur Bhandarkar?s Indu Sarkar.One is to look it as a propaganda film against the Congress party, aims at showcasing the atrocities inflicted upon various communities during the Emergency. There is a subtle, yet, extremely clear attempt to highlight Muslims forming a major portion of the victims. We have Neil Nitin Mukesh channelling Sanjay Gandhi as the prime minister?s son who is only referred to as the ?chief? while the PM is referred to as ?mummyji?. The unofficial ban on Kishore Kumar from radio and television after he refused to sing for Sanjay Gandhi also gets a mention in the film. On the other hand, you can see Indu Sarkar as a double-edged sword. While it depicts the Emergency and the Gandhi family as the perpetrators of cruelty and injustice inflicted upon the masses, the film actually shows the misuse of power. If Madhur Bhandarkar wanted to patronise the ruling party, the irony of his own film is lost on him. The irony of Indu Sarkar is that it is so indulgent in highlighting the importance of free speech and democracy that you could change a few names, few other situations and it could well have been a film about the crisis India is facing today: People with allegiances to the ruling party exploiting the masses and even politicians at their own will.So, in the sheer hope that Madhur actually aimed for the latter political purpose, two stars for Indu Sarkar.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

Anand had told the bench that also comprised Justices A M Khanwilkar and M M Shantanagoudar.?The government has asked the CBSE to consider whether jammers can be installed in schools to curb access to such websites,? she had said.The apex court had asked the government to file a status report within two days on the steps taken by it to stop child pornography.The court is dealing with a petition which has sought a direction to the Centre to take appropriate steps to curb child pornography across the country.

"A golgappa seller in outer Delhi's Mangolpuri area was killed on Sunday by five people who stabbed him 18 times after he refused to serve them. The police have held all the five accused, including two juveniles, and said that they have confessed to the crime. The accused told the police that they were drunk and got enraged over refusal.","Summarise: Three men have been arrested and two juveniles apprehended for allegedly murdering a golgappa seller in outer Delhi?s Mangolpuri on Sunday night. Raju (24) was stabbed 18 times after he refused to serve golgappe to the five accused, police said. According to the police, the five have confessed to their involvement in the murder. During the interrogation, the five reportedly told the police that they were drunk and got enraged when Raju refused to serve them golgappe. They have been identified as Gogi (22), Anil (28) and Nikhil (24) - all residents of Mangolpuri. Raju lived with his family in Mangolpuri?s I-Block and sold the street snack at a roadside cart with his father, Radhey Shyam. On Sunday around 11.30 pm, he had closed his shop and was returning home. His father was walking about 200 metres ahead and had almost reached home. Police said when Raju reached I-Block, five men consuming alcohol stopped him and asked him to serve golgappe. Raju told them he did not have the ingredients to make them.?The men insisted on having golgappe. When Raju refused, they began assaulting him. One of them took out a knife and stabbed him multiple times till he collapsed on the road,? said an investigating officer. Hearing Raju?s screams, his family and neighbours rushed to him but the attackers had fled by then. However, they managed to see at least two of the five attackers. A neighbour then informed the police. Raju was rushed to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. The doctors said Raju suffered 18 stab injuries that punctured his vital organs, police said.A case of murder was registered at the Mangolpuri police station and three teams were formed to nab the attackers, who were suspected to be from the same locality. According to MN Tiwari, deputy commissioner of police (outer district), they zeroed in on Gogi, who had been missing after the crime. His cellphone records showed that he kept changing his location as he knew that raids were being carried out at his possible hideouts. ?Through our technical surveillance and criminal intelligence network, we tracked down Gogi?s location in Agra and arrested him on Monday night. His interrogation led us to the other accused,? added the DCP.Tiwari said that Gogi was previously involved in seven cases of theft and carjacking. Anil too has a criminal background and was involved in ten criminal cases. Nikhil did not have a criminal background but he was often seen with petty criminals of Mangolpuri."
"BCCI intervened and cut short Indian captain Virat Kohli's first official media interaction after the appointment of Ravi Shastri as the team's head coach. The media interaction, which was the last before the team left for the Sri Lanka tour on Wednesday, was supposed to be 15 minutes long but was cut short to 10 minutes.","Summarise: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) made it clear on Wednesday that it wants to quickly get over the Anil Kumble controversy.It was the first official media interaction of skipper Virat Kohli and new coach Ravi Shastri together, before the team left for the Sri Lanka tour on Wednesday. The interaction was supposed to be for 15 minutes, but was reduced to just 10 minutes for no apparent reason.Many hands went up to get a chance to ask questions, but the opportunity never arrived for most. The haphazard and abrupt manner in which the press conference ended gave one the feeling that BCCI wanted to avoid Kohli having to field any question on Kumble?s unceremonious departure as coach despite emphatic performances by the team.READ?|?Ravi Shastri takes subtle dig at Sourav Ganguly-led Cricket Advisory CommitteeKohli had initially rubbished reports of a rift between Kumble and the Indian team, saying during the ICC Champions Trophy that there were ?no problems? between him and Kumble, and the reports were just ?rumours? created by the media.That the captain and coach were not on talking terms and were not seeing eye-to-eye was evident even during the training sessions at the Champions Trophy.While the Indian team left for the West Indies from London, Kumble stayed back for an ICC meeting and then announced he was not seeking an extension to his one-year term. Following that Kohli even deleted a year-old tweet welcoming Kumble.Kohli has avoided publicly discussing Kumble?s departure and has insisted that would mean violating the sanctity of dressing room discussions not coming out.READ?|?Ravi Shastri insists players more important to India than coachWhen Kohli was asked about getting his choice of coach and support staff, he said: ?I think understanding and communication is something that works in every walk of life and the dressing room environment is nothing different.?When Shastri was asked the same question, he said: ?I will answer that same question wearing two hats and I promise you there is no conflict of interest here. One as a player and as a former captain, when you play the game you want your mind to be clear.

"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for 'centralising power' and taking away the independence of the states. ""Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister?"" Thackeray questioned in an interview to the party's mouthpiece Saamana.","Summarise: swapnil.rawal@hindustantimes.comThe Shiv Sena launched yet another scathing attack on its ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through its mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday. In an interview to the newspaper, party chief Uddhav Thackeray attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of ?centralising? power.In a chat with Sena Member of Parliament and executive editor of Saamana Sanjay Raut, Thackeray attacked Modi over his style of functioning, demonetisation, Good and Services Tax (GST) and the PM?s poll pitch ?acche din?. ?The ?acche din? are only limited to government advertisement; the ground reality is completely different. Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister? He is centralising power, instead of decentralising it. He is taking away the independence of the states,? Thackeray said.Thackeray, who has been a staunch critic of demonetisation, said the move has not yielded anything positive, instead, it has affected the livelihood of people. ?Around 15 lakh people lost their jobs because of demonetisation. This means around 60 lakh people were directly affected. You should give them jobs now. How are you going to balance ?Start-up India?, ?Make in India? programmes with such colossal job losses? ? Thackeray asked.He also slammed the state government over the farm loan waiver. Thackeray said the government should table the list of 36 lakh farmers, who were going to get the benefit of the waiver in the upcoming Monsoon session. He said the party would continue its ?dhol bajao andolan? (protest by beating drums) to turn the heat on the government over implementing the loan waiver.Interestingly, the Sena chief said he shares a cordial relationship with Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. ?There was no personal animosity between me and the current chief minister. My relation with him is really good. Often, he has accepted the suggestions I have given. He is putting forward views of his party, I am representing the people of the state. The difference is only that,? he said.The two parties share an uncomfortable relationship ever since 2014 Assembly polls where they contested independently. Earlier in 2017, the BJP and the Sena parted ways for the Mumbai civic elections. Sena, which is the junior partner in the central and state governments, has never missed an opportunity to speak up against the BJP and the prime minister. Reiterating his stand, Thackeray said he and his party will continue to speak up whenever they disagree with the decision of the BJP in the state and at the Centre. ?I want to explain my stand here. Whenever I say something or Sena speaks, we are considered anti-government. I am not anti-government. I am merely on the side of the people,? he said."
"After the British public voted to name a polar research vessel Boaty McBoatface, Sweden has voted to name a train Trainy McTrainface. Trainy McTrainface received 49% of the votes, beating options like Poseidon and Miriam. Swedes have previously named trains Estelle, after the five-year-old Swedish Princess, and Glenn, after a long-running joke that everyone in Gothenburg city is named Glenn.","Summarise: It?s happened again. A public vote to name four trains running between the Swedish cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg has resulted in one of the four being called Trainy McTrainface in an echo of the name chosen by the British public for the new polar research vessel.Trainy McTrainface received 49% of the votes in a poll, jointly run by Swedish rail company MTR Express and Swedish newspaper Metro.That placed it well ahead the other three options: Hakan, Miriam and Poseidon.The other trains have already been named by the public: one is named Estelle, after the five-year-old daughter of Sweden?s Princess Victoria, the next in line to the Swedish throne.Another is named Glenn, after a long-running joke that everyone in Gothenburg is called Glenn. The joke has a basis in fact: the name is particularly common in the city and its surrounding area, with its popularity stemming from the 1980s, when local football team IFK GÃ¶teborg had four players all called Glenn in its lineup. Forty-three per cent of voters supported the name Glenn.The fourth train has yet to be named. A fifth train, Ingvar, after the Swedish TV personality Ingvar Oldsberg, was named before voting began.The public vote was eventually overruled in the case of Boaty McBoatface and the ship named the RRS Sir David Attenborough, with an onboard submersible receiving the Boatface appellation.MTR Express said the McBoatface decision had led to disappointment worldwide and it hoped the name Trainy McTrainface would ?be received with joy by many, not only in Sweden?."

Stay tuned as we bring you all the latest updates. (LIVE SCORECARD)Virat Kohli: Coming back here after a while. It has been a long time since we played the IPL final. Even after losing all three tosses, we won the series, just like the Test series. It is not a very bad thing to have MS Dhoni behind the stumps. I am new to the limited overs format and I keep taking help. A lot of credit goes to them. Yes, that too and that one over from Jordan to Yuvi. We thought 175-180, but that over took us to 200. Credit to Chahal, he knows the ground better. I have a lot of faith in him and he plays his cricket with confidence. He has to maintain his orginality and it is great to have a guy who has so much zeal. I wanted to send him up, but he is the one to say he will bat down the order. He is a champion player and he is a match-winner. Come to the big game, he stepped up. It is a memorable tour. When we went to England we lost the Test series. It has been a brilliant couple of months for this side. Yuzvendra Chahal: I felt nice playing my first match at Bengaluru for India. I have bowled in the poweplay in the IPL and Virat has the confidence in me to give me the ball. I plan according to how the batsman plays. Even Dhoni used to tell me what the batsman is going to play. Mishy bowled well in the last match as well, looking at him I get the confidence to toss the ball up. Eoin Morgan: We lost two in batsmen and it really hurt us. It was an excellent spell from Chahal. Credit should be given where it is due. India played the better cricket today. Beautiful wicket to bat and we would have taken 190-200 at the beginning. We take a lot of things. The biggest thing is our bowling. We showed improvement in our bowling department.

Tried my best. Bangalore has always been a batting paradise. We put up a very good total and the bowlers bowled very well. 202 was a par score in Bangalore. Great bowling performance by the bowlers.

The pressure got the better off the visiting side as Morgan and Root departed in back-to-back deliveries. It was a horrendous performance from thereon as they lost 8 wickets for 8 runs in the space of 18 deliveries.

"For the first time in Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections, the None Of The Above (NOTA) option was made available during polling which took place on Sunday. While the total number of voters in the Delhi civic polls stood at more than 1.32 crore, the voter turnout was recorded low at 54%.","Summarise: Delhi residents will vote in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections today. The result of the poll is bound to have an impact beyond the borders of the capital.With AAP, Congress and BJP in the fray for the crucial polls, the national capital witnessed an aggressive campaign.The election will determine if Arvind Kejriwal's AAP will retain power in Delhi. AAP made inroads in the 2015 Assembly polls by winning 67 seats out of 70.The BJP, meanwhile, has fielded new candidates across the 267 wards. Earlier this week, the party had expelled one of its candidate from Narela for allegedly involving sacked AAP minister Sandeep Kumar in the campaign.The Congress, which finished second in the Rajouri Garden bypoll, is hoping for a resurgence and banked on its big guns during campaigns to shore up its fortune, despite unabated infighting.

The SP today said it has 30 candidates altogether but two of them have died.TUSSLE OVER EVM CONTINUESThe Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj India is also in the fray. The run-up to the polls have also been dominated by allegations of tampered EVMs - a charge made by Kejriwal, but rejected by the Election Commission.The Generation-1 electronic voting machines (EVMs) are to be used for the MCD elections, which the Commission has described as ""foolproof"". The State Election Commission is gearing up to carry out the electoral exercise that will be spread over 13,000 booths spanning 272 wards.Over 1.3 crore people are eligible to vote in the polls and of them more than 1.1 lakh are first-time voters.

Vishwas said.Vishwas also blamed a ?coterie? within the AAP for its election reverses but did not elaborate.Though Vishwas said he will not join ?any other party?, he kept his options open for leaving the AAP.?I don?t want to become the chief minister, deputy chief minister, convener of a party and neither do I want to join any other party.... I didn?t come to do this. I will take a decision tonight....?An hour later deputy, Sisodia criticised Vishwas for speaking to the media rather than raising his concerns in the party forum.?We have gone to meet him several times. Arvind himself met him and spoke to him for three hours at his house. Still, he is not coming to attend the PAC (political affairs committee meetings), and is only talking to TV,? Sisodia said.?Party workers know very well which party or which power is benefitting from his repeated statements on TV channels,? the deputy CM said, seen as a reference to the BJP.He also rubbished Vishwas? claims of being one of the founders of the AAP.?He (Vishwas) is repeatedly saying this party was founded by three people ? Arvind Kejriwal, me and Kumar Vishwas. This is totally worng. This party was formed by the lakhs of party workers in India and abroad.?Kejriwal had earlier defended Vishwas by terming him a ?brother?. But political experts believe that Vishwas may have have crossed the red line for the temperamental chief minister, who is often accused of building the party around himself."

A Class 12 textbook meant for Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students is putting all speculation over that question to rest, declaring authoritatively that the much-celebrated 36-24-36 figure is, in fact, the ""best"" body shape for females.It's not all hyperbole, though. The textbook, which The News Minute reports is titled Health and Physical Education Textbook, goes on to reason that even Miss World and Miss Universe beauty pageants take the 36-24-36 body shape into consideration while judging their contestants.An image of the section of the textbook comparing the physical and anatomical differences between males and females was initially posted on social media by a Twitter user named Anuj Khurana.The textbook doesn't stop at just female body shapes. A cursory sentence in the section on 'Differences in shape' says that when it comes to males, the 'V' body shape is considered the best.According to The News Minute, the textbook has published by the New Saraswati House and not the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), which usually brings out textbooks used in CBSE schools.After reports of the textbook started coming to light, the CBSE issued a clarification saying schools must take responsibility if they choose to include books of private publishers in their curriculum. The CBSE has been in the news recently for seemingly controversial content that has appeared in its textbooks or examination papers.Just a week ago, Class 12 students appearing for their biology examinations, were asked to answer which practice between burial and cremation was better. The students were asked to base their answers on which practice would help contain air pollution the best.And, earlier this year, news emerged about a Class 4 textbook for environmental studies seemingly encouraging students to carry out an experiment that could lead to a kitten's death.""You can do an experiment"" a paragraph accompanied by graphics said, going on to encourage students to place two kittens in separate wooden boxes, one with holes in the lid and another one without.The purpose? To show students how, if they carried out the experiment, the kitten in the box without holes would die."

Babies with this condition are perpetually jaundiced as their liver does not produce an enzyme that is necessary to break down bilirubin, a yellowish bi-product of body?s natural processes, to an excretable form.?The light emitted during phototherapy helps the bilirubin to break down to the excretable form and does the work of the enzyme. However, as the child grows and the skin becomes thicker, they need to stay under the blue light for longer periods,? said Dr Sibbal.The normal bilirubin count is 1; Khalid?s count was 30 when he underwent a liver transplant at Indraprastha Apollo hospital to reverse the condition. ?The unconjugated bilirubin, one of the four types, can go into the brain and cause permanent damage. It can also lead to deafness,? said Dr Anupam Sibbal, group medical director of Apollo Hospitals.

A three-year-old was sexually assaulted by a man who worked at the nursery school located in Bellandur in Karnataka's capital city Bengaluru. The accused school staffer was arrested soon after a complaint was filed by the parents of the kid. An FIR has also been registered against the school after the incident which took place on Friday.,"Summarise: In yet another shocker from the city, a three-and-a-half-year old girl was sexually assaulted in her nursery school located in Bellandur by the supervisor who was later arrested. The incident came to light on Friday when the girl upon returning from school complained about pain in her private part and after some questioning by her parents, she told them that, 'Manju Bhaiya,' who works in her school had put his finger in there.The parents immediately rushed to the school and confronted principal Dr. Veena who initially denied the possibility of such an incident taking place. However, the little girl identified the man and said that the incident has happened 5-6 times.The parents then took their little one to the nearby Sakra hospital for a thorough check up. It was the hospital authorities who asked the parents to register an FIR without waiting for the school to do so. The father of the victim tells us that initially Dr. Veena was willing to register an FIR but later on only said the school would provide support and nothing more. He told India Today that she was adamant that the incident did not take place and hence would not register an FIR against the supervisor who has worked for more than 8 years in the school.On Friday evening while at the hospital itself, the parents with the help of the security staff at the Sakra hospital filed a complaint with the police. The father of the victim said that the constables came to the hospital and began to take down the complaint. But when they heard what he had to say, they immediately stopped writing and asked him to come with them to the police station. Later on in the evening, the police along with the victim's father went to the nursery school and demanded the supervisor address. He was immediately arrested and booked under the very stringent POCSO Act.On Monday as word spread, many more parents reached the school and demanded strict action against the principal. Some have alleged that their children as well have been touched inappropriately by the same school supervisor. 'My kid's thigh was touched when she would go to the washroom by the accused in spite of an aaya being present,' is what one parent told India Today. Others came out with more damning experiences their kids recounted to them.Such being the case, they wanted a case of criminal negligence be filed against the principal. But with the school authorities resorting to delaying tactics, they began to protest in the school premises till the police arrived on the spot and brought the situation under control. The principal was finally detained by the police and that was when she changed track saying she was always with the parents.Major Aditi (Retd), a child and human rights activist in the city assisted the parents in making sure that the police stopped wasting time. Speaking to India Today Aditi said, ""I want to know whether the principal was competent enough to run the school in the first place and why the most basic measures were not being followed. We have spoken about measures to be put in place so why was the little girl not escorted by an aaya to the washroom, what was the male supervisor doing there.""As of now, the school has been shut until further notice and the parents want a full-fledged investigation to take place.WATCH: Another Bengaluru horror: Woman groped, molested by bike-borne men in dark alley"
"To transform India's economy, it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that India is integrated with the global economy, Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy has said. Further, he said there is a need to reduce ""friction"" in businesses and create an ""environment"" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs. ","Summarise: From Lalit K Jha Charlottesville (US), Apr 13 (PTI) To transform Indias economy, there is a need to reduce ""friction"" in businesses and create an ""environment"" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy has said. For the transformation of the Indian economy, he said it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that India is integrated with the global economy. ""We still have a little bit of work in reducing friction to businesses. We need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today,"" Murthy, 70, told students of the prestigious Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia here. Murthy, the recipient of the 2017 Thomas Jefferson Foundation medal in Global Innovation, was responding to Darden School of Business Dean Scott Beardsley who asked, ""what do you think needs to happen next to transform Indias economy. What is next"". ""We want our youngsters to be a little bit more daring in taking the entrepreneurial route more and more than the extent to which they do today. We have to become much more integrated to the world economy so that we can consider the entire world as our market and can become globally competitive. ""And most importantly we can become much more open minded to learn from the wonderful things that are happening in this country and elsewhere. I would say these are required (for transforming Indias economy to the next level),"" Murthy said. He, however, refrained from elaborating what the Indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, ""I will tell you why, as an Indian citizen, it may not be proper if I were to be critical about India when I am outside India"". Interacting with students, he said, challenges for entrepreneurs are now different than the time when he started Infosys. Those days access to capital was almost non-existent and government was a big irritant. ""Today, challenges are different. But in some sense even more complex, because todays entrepreneurs have to be much more smarter than what we were because there is so much of competition on a global scale. Before you can say this can be done, somebody else may have already done it. ""Therefore, todays entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in India,"" he said. Murthy said good governance is all about maximising shareholders value while ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability to all stake holders. Of all the stakeholders, society is the most important player. ""Respect from the society is the most important ingredient for longevity of a corporation,"" he said. ""To be honoured by the most innovative country in the world and to be awarded a medal in the name of Thomas Jefferson, author of Declaration of Independence is to me a big honour. I will certainly work hard, and hopefully smart in the remaining years of my life, to deserve this kindness, this generosity and this affection on their part,"" he told PTI. The fact that the university has seen it fit to pick up somebody from India, and bestow this honour shows how open this country is and how generous they are, Murthy said. ""Therefore this is a clear example of how Indian students wherever they are whether in India or here or anywhere else can be sure that as long as they are good citizens of this world, contribute to make the society a better place through peaceful and harmonious methods, they will be recognised, appreciated,"" he said. Murthy said that Indian students are making a positive impact in the countries they are studying. "

"Reliance Jio will be able to generate revenue of about ?21,300 crore for the current financial year, assuming its 7.2 crore Prime users pay for services between July 2017 and March 2018, ratings agency Moody's said. Further, Jio's paid customers are ""credit positive"" for Reliance Industries, it noted. Jio's aggressive stance will ensure heightened competition in the sector, it added.","Summarise: New Delhi, Apr 5 (PTI) Newcomer Jios 72 million paid customers are ""credit positive"" for parent Reliance Industries as subscriber enrolment reduces cash flow uncertainty of the telecom business, Moodys Investors Service said today. Moodys calculation shows that Jio will be able to generate revenue of about Rs 213 billion (Rs 21,300 crore) for the current financial year, assuming all 72 million users pay Rs 303 per 28 days between July 2017 and March 2018. On the enrolment of paid subscribers, Moodys Investors Service said, ""This is credit positive as the subscriber enrolment reduces cash flow uncertainty of the telecom business, on which RIL has spent over Rs 1.7 trillion (Rs 1,70,000 crore) over the last six years."" Jio, in February, said it has enrolled 100 million users for its free services that was slated to end on March 31. The company had also announced that it would start charging for services from April 1 and introduced Jio-Prime membership, a discounted set of price plans to incentivise non-paying subscribers to subscribe to paid services. It has now extended by a fortnight the deadline for enrolment to its Jio-Prime plan, and as per its last update has 72 million paid customers. Also, it has announced that all Prime members who subscribe to higher value plans (Rs 303 and above) will enjoy complimentary services for three months and that subscribers will only be charged for services from July. ""... there was uncertainty about the success rate of transitioning non-paying subscribers to paid plans, but that uncertainty has now reduced to a large extent,"" the statement by Moodys said. It further said a significant portion of the 72 million subscribers are expected to opt for Rs 303 plan, given that it is the minimum plan that gives complimentary services for three months. ""However, as the price plan does not require the subscriber to commit beyond the 28 days, they are free to switch at any time after that,"" it said, adding that Prime membership will therefore have to continue to be competitive and maintain service quality to retain customers. The company may have to revisit its price plans beyond April 15 to attract and retain subscribers who do not sign up for the Prime offering, it noted. "
"Pope Francis' chief financial adviser and third-highest Vatican official Cardinal George Pell was charged with multiple sexual assault offences on Thursday. He is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be charged in the church's long-running sexual abuse scandal. Pell, accused of touching two boys inappropriately in a pool in the 1970s, has denied the allegations and vowed to ""clear his name.""","Summarise: Australian police charged a top Vatican cardinal on Thursday with multiple counts of historical sexual assault offenses, a stunning decision certain to rock the highest levels of the Holy See.Cardinal George Pell, Pope Francis' chief financial adviser and Australia's most senior Catholic, is the highest-ranking Vatican official to ever be charged in the church's long-running sexual abuse scandal. Pell said he would return to Australia to fight the charges.Victoria state Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said police have summonsed Pell to appear in an Australian court to face multiple charges of ""historical sexual assault offenses,"" meaning offenses that generally occurred some time ago. Patton said there are multiple complainants against Pell, but gave no other details on the allegations against the cardinal. Pell was ordered to appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on July 18.The Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney issued a statement on behalf of Pell, saying the 76-year-old cardinal ""strenuously denied all allegations"" and would return to Australia to clear his name.""He said he is looking forward to his day in court and will defend the charges vigorously,"" the statement said.Patton told reporters in Melbourne that none of the allegations against Pell had been tested in any court, adding: ""Cardinal Pell, like any other defendant, has a right to due process.""The charges are a new and serious blow to Pope Francis, who has already suffered several credibility setbacks in his promised ""zero tolerance"" policy about sex abuse.For years, Pell has faced allegations that he mishandled cases of clergy abuse when he was archbishop of Melbourne and, later, Sydney. His actions as archbishop came under intense scrutiny in recent years by a government-authorized investigation into how the Catholic Church and other institutions have responded to the sexual abuse of children. Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse - the nation's highest form of inquiry - has found shocking levels of abuse in Australia's Catholic Church, revealing earlier this year that 7 percent of Catholic priests were accused of sexually abusing children over the past several decades.Last year, Pell acknowledged during his testimony to the commission that the Catholic Church had made ""enormous mistakes"" in allowing thousands of children to be raped and molested by priests over centuries. He conceded that he, too, had erred by often believing the priests over victims who alleged abuse. And he vowed to help end a rash of suicides that has plagued church abuse victims in his Australian hometown of Ballarat.But more recently, Pell himself became the focus of a clergy sex abuse investigation, with Victoria detectives flying to the Vatican last year to interview the cardinal. It is unclear what allegations the charges announced Thursday relate to, but two men, now in their 40s, have said that Pell touched them inappropriately at a swimming pool in the late 1970s, when Pell was a senior priest in Melbourne.'PELL WILL RETURN TO AUSTRALIA'Australia has no extradition treaty with the Vatican. But in the statement from the Sydney Archdiocese, Pell said he would return to Australia ""as soon as possible,"" following advice and approval by his doctors. Last year, Pell declined to return to Australia to testify for the third time before the Royal Commission, saying he was too ill to fly. He instead testified via video conference from Rome.The charges put Pope Francis in a thorny position. In 2014, Francis won cautious praise from victims' advocacy groups when he created a commission of outside experts to advise him and the broader church about ""best practices"" to fight abuse and protect children.But the commission has since lost much of its credibility after its two members who were survivors of abuse left. Francis also scrapped the commission's signature proposal - a tribunal section to hear cases of bishops who covered up for abuse - after Vatican officials objected.In addition, Francis drew heated criticism for his 2015 appointment of a Chilean bishop accused by victims of helping cover up for Chile's most notorious pedophile. The pope was later caught on videotape labeling the parishioners who opposed the nomination of being ""leftists"" and ""stupid.""When Francis was asked last year about the accusations against Pell, he said he wanted to wait for Australian justice to take its course before judging. ""It's true, there is a doubt,"" he told reporters en route home from Poland. ""We have to wait for justice and not first make a mediatic judgment - a judgment of gossip - because that won't help.""""Once justice has spoken, I will speak,"" he said.Francis appointed Pell in 2014 to a five-year term to head the Vatican's new economy secretariat, giving him broad rein to control all economic, administrative, personnel and procurement functions of the Holy See. The mandate has since been restricted to performing more of an oversight role.It remains to be seen how the pope will respond to the developments.Given Francis' credibility is on the line, any decision to keep Pell on as prefect while facing charges would reflect poorly on Francis, given he remains one of the pope's top advisers.At the same time, the Vatican has a history of shielding its own: When Cardinal Bernard Law resigned in disgrace in 2002 over his cover-up of abuse in Boston, victims expressed outrage that St. John Paul II gave him a plum position as archpriest of a Rome basilica.The transfer spared Law what would likely have been years of litigation and testimony in U.S. courts as victims sued the archdioceses for their abuse, though Law himself was never criminally charged with wrongdoing.In the 1980s, the Vatican refused to cooperate with Italian investigators when one of its officials, Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus, was indicted over a banking scandal. The Vatican successfully cited his diplomatic immunity."
"Over 14,000 cases of bonded labour have been received since 1993 to January 31, 2017, out of which 13,266 were disposed of, NHRC has reported.

""Bonded labour is one of the worst violations of human rights and also the dignity of life.

""In order to monitor the compliance of recommendations on bonded labour, the Commission has also devised a detailed reporting questionnaire format and sent it to all the states/union territories. So far, the Commission has not received information from 12 states and 6 union territories,"" he added. The NHRC chairperson also said it would be wrong to think that bonded labour is a thing of past, as it can be found even today in not only agriculture but also in other sectors of employment including brick kilns, stone quarries, salt fields, lather manufacturing units and so on. ""As long as there is poverty, unemployment, underemployment, landlessness, migration, indebtedness, the pernicious bonded labour system will continue,"" he lamented. "
"Union Minister Babul Supriyo on Monday said the underwater tunnel of East-West Metro Corridor Project in Kolkata, built below the Ganga river bed, is the first of its kind in the country.

""This is the first such project in the country. Building a tunnel under the river had never taken place elsewhere in India. Further being built under Ganga, it has an emotional value as well,"" Supriyo, who went inside the tunnel between slab numbers 820 and 840, said. He has been asked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to personally supervise the work, said Supriyo while interacting with the officials of Afcons-Transtonnelstroy of South Africa, the agency to build the tunnel between Howrah Maidan and the proposed Mahakaran metro station near Writers Buildings here. Supriyo also collected soil from the place and kept it in two utensils - one for gifting to the prime minister and another for himself as a memento. The entire stretch of tunnel from Howrah Maidan to the Ganga bank in the city will be 1.7 km, of which a significant part will be on the surface. ""Basically, we reached almost the bottom of the Ganga and spent a considerable time (there). It was an exhilarating experience. I salute the engineers and the workers for the heroic work,"" Supriyo, the Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises said. Asked about the safety of the project, he said ""Let me allay any apprehension about the safety. We did not feel uncomfortable inside though we were 32 m below the river water - that is the sea level."" He said the tunnel went under buildings like Howrah Station but there were no threat to them as the latest technology had been used. The tunnel boring machine (TBM), used in the excavation work, will now go beyond the slab number 840 to dig up earth under the river bed and finally reach the east bank - that is the city. Expressing hope that the Howrah Maidan-Esplanade part of Phase II of the project, which would connect Howrah Maidan to Sealdah) will not miss the deadline, Supriyo said ""We expect to clear the logjam in the wake of the existing rule that infrastructure projects would not come up within 100 m of the heritage buildings."" ""There are three heritage constructions - two synagogues and the Currency Building within 30 m of the proposed tunnel. But IIT-Kharagpur in a feasibility study said the tunnel work and metro movement would not cause any damage to the structures."" ""We are not setting up a time-frame and the Union cabinet is preparing a note to exempt the Metro work. Lets hope for the best,"" he said. The entire second phase of the East West Project, with 100 per cent funding by the Centre, had been facilitated by the West Bengal government with intervention by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her cabinet colleagues to clear settlements. Phase 1 of the East-West Metro Corridor Project, he said, is expected to be completed on time and thanked Banerjee for removing encroachments along the route. ""During my chance meeting with the West Bengal CM in 2015 which the media had christened as Jhalmuri diplomacy, I had broached the topic of encroachment and with the intervention of TMC leaders it was resolved. ""The encroachers will be relocated in a new building in the area,"" he said. "

The boy, now 16, who was 15 at the time of the alleged attack and cannot be named for legal reasons, denies the manslaughter of Arkadiusz JÃ³?wik, 40, from Poland.JÃ³?wik was knocked unconscious outside a row of takeaway shops in Harlow, Essex, in August last year, and later died in hospital from head injuries. He had been drinking with two friends and had just bought a pizza when he was set upon. On Tuesday, Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, told Chelmsford crown court: ?The prosecution does not say that [the boy] thought for a moment that what he did would result in the death of a man. ?However, we say he moved deliberately around the back of Mr JÃ³?wik to take him by surprise and to hit him from behind. ?[He] jumped up from the ground, using the whole force of his body to hit Mr JÃ³?wik to his head.

The defendant sat with his parents at the back of the courtroom, and the judge, Patricia Lynch, and barristers sat without their wigs and robes due to his age. Cottage said JÃ³?wik had been drinking vodka with his friend Radek Koscelski and they were both ?speaking loudly and appeared to be drunk and smelled of alcohol?. She said a third friend, Jakub Lusiecki, drank beer and ?appeared to be sober?. The three men sat on a bench near a group of teenagers with bikes, including the defendant, who had been there for most of the day, Cottage said. The attention of the Polish men was drawn to the group of teenagers, she continued, as ?something was kicked or thrown close to them? in the Stow shopping precinct. ?There was some laughter about their English and one of the teenagers was cycling around the group,? Cottage said, adding that Koscelski ?was swaying and drunk and may have been argumentative, offering to fight?, but made no physical contact. Cottage said two boys cycled close to Koscelski and JÃ³?wik, which ?seemed to spark a disagreement? between the two groups. Showing CCTV footage to jurors, she said it appeared that Koscelski tripped over his own feet, then the defendant ?appears to jump in the air and swing his arm with force to the head of Mr JÃ³?wik?.

Blood alcohol tests on JÃ³?wik showed he was around ?twice over the legal limit to drive?, Cottage said. ?Mr Koscelski was clearly very drunk and the deceased Mr JÃ³?wik was also drunk, but the prosecution says there was no need for violence to be offered to either man. We say he was not aggressive to the group and certainly not [the defendant].?For whatever reason, maybe even just immature bravado, the prosecution say [he] took a deliberate decision to use unlawful violence when he went around the back of the group to punch Mr JÃ³?wik.?In a police video interview shown to the jury, a teenage boy who was in the group with the defendant on the night said two Polish men approached them. ?Both of them were saying ?Fight me?,? he said. Asked by the detective how he felt when they came over, the boy replied: ?I felt scared because they were quite big and tall. I didn?t know why they came over asking for a fight.? Asked if he heard any comments made about the Polish language, he replied: ?No.? Further asked if he had heard any derogatory comments about the men based on them being Polish, he said he was not aware of any. The trial continues."

"Archaeologists on Saturday unearthed a two-metre high, centuries-old statue believed to have been the symbolic guardian of an ancient hospital at the Angkor temple complex in Cambodia. The statue is believed to date back to the late 12th to early 13th century. Angkor was the capital of the Khmer Empire, which dates from the 9th to the 15th centuries. ","Summarise: Archaeologists have unearthed a large, centuries-old statue that is believed to have once stood guard over an ancient hospital at Cambodia?s famed Angkor temple complex.The nearly two metre tall carving, which is thought to be from the late 12th to the early 13th century, was discovered during a dig on Saturday, said Long Kosal, a spokesman for Apsara Authority ? the state agency charged with managing the complex. The Angkor Archeological Park, a world heritage site, contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries, and is Cambodia?s most popular tourist destination.At the height of its power the city and its hundreds of temples boasted more than a million inhabitants, making it one of the world?s most populous pre-industrial centres. Huge swathes of the park have been excavated over the decades, creating a walkable archaeological wonder that attracts more than two million visitors a year. But the complex remains a treasure trove for yet to be discovered finds. Cambodian archaeologists and experts from Singapore?s Institute of Southeast Asian Studies found the statue buried 40 centimeters under the ground during an excavation of an Angkor-era hospital built during the reign of King Jayavarman VII.The Apsara agency said the sandstone statue?s arms and legs had broken off but the carving on the body and head ?remain beautiful? despite the passage of time. They said the statue was likely to have been a symbolic guardian of the hospital.Â "
"The first Indian-origin woman in space, Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962. Chawla moved to the United States in 1982 and joined NASA in 1988. Describing her first mission in space, she said, ""You are just your intelligence"", on experiencing weightlessness. The astronaut died with six crew members on her second mission aboard the Columbia spacecraft in 2003.","Summarise: For two months after she became the first Indian woman to be launched in space, 35-year-old Kalpana Chawla, the Karnal-born scientist, remained incommunicado. That's largely because the National Space and Aeronautical Administration (NASA), the authority that controls space flights in the US, was investigating what went wrong with one of the missions that Chawla and her five other crew members had to undertake during their 15-day space odyssey in November last year. Chawla was assigned the task of releasing Spartan, the $10 million (Rs 40 crore) solar-physics satellite from the space shuttle's bay. Either a systems malfunction or an error of judgement caused it to spin out of control and it took a daring space walk by the crew to retrieve it. NASA investigation showed it was the result of a series of small errors and absolved Chawla, calling her ""a terrific astronaut"". In an exclusive telephone interview from Houston, she spoke to Deputy Editor Raj Chengappa last week. Excerpts:Q. When you were first free from the clutches of gravity after lift-off, can you describe the physical and mental feeling?A. When you lift off the pressure is supposed to be maximum. But actually it was very benign. Very enjoyable. But as soon as the engines cut off and you get to zero gravity, you felt as if you were being pushed off your seat. You feel disoriented. You don't feel aligned with anything. I felt for a few good hours that I was falling. In fact, you are in a free fall- that's what zero gravity is all about. But the first few hours, the workload was so much that it was hard to realise the magic of the experience. But afterwards the feeling was literally out of this world.Q. What is the strangest thing about being in zero gravity?A. One of the strangest things is that when I was about to sleep, I realised I was only aware of my thoughts. Because you are weightless you don't feel your legs or your body. In a sense then, you are just your intelligence. It's amazing you can't feel anything but your consciousness.Q. How did you feel about becoming the first Indian woman to be in space?A. I never truly thought of being the first or second someone. Or being a small-town girl. This is just something I wanted to do. It was very important for me to enjoy it. If you want to do something, what does it matter where you are ranked? Nor does being a woman make a difference. We were all just crew members.Q. Did looking down at the earth from space change your concept of it?A. It did. The first view of the earth is magical. All of us had grown fond of watching the Himalayas pass by. I saw the Brahmaputra and how it turned to meet the Ganges. And the Ganges delta looked very serene. What is mindboggling is the tremendous speed we were going at. We crossed the Himalayas in less than two minutes, and then you realise, ""Oh My God"" within an hour and a half, we have gone around the whole planet. It is a very overpowering realisation that the earth is so small. The atmosphere looks like a ribbon with different colours hugging the earth. That, in addition, lends so much to its fragility. It affected me. I could not get over the notion that in such a small planet, with such a small ribbon of life, so much goes on.Q. Did you think about Karnal or India?A. We passed over India lots of times. And sometimes I would think, oh I have been there. Especially while passing over New Delhi. You couldn't really spot it but I pointed it out to my crew members and said I lived near there. But I really didn't see countries by themselves, I just saw land.Q. Does the earth look all blue from up there?A. The earth is not just a bluish hue. You actually see all the colours. It was spectacular. For example, when the Sahara comes into view, the ocean near it is an emerald green. It is shockingly beautiful. The Sahara itself looks golden brown. Then you cross the Nile, and it looks like a deep, dark green ribbon and immediately you can tell why it is the lifeline of the desert.Q. How did it affect you? A. The nice thing about it is that if there are any blemishes, it is lost. Everything looks pretty. It is as if the whole place is sacred. You get the feeling that I need to work extraordinarily hard along with other human beings to respect that.Q. Do you see the pollution?A. I did see it and it was one of the unfortunate sights. For instance, you can see smokestacks. We saw fires, one over Australia. We also saw smog layers over Taiwan.Q. Did you long for Indian food when you were up in space?A. My crewmates, especially my Japanese colleague who loves curries, would say: ""How can you survive with the stuff we are eating here?"" I would just laugh it off. I didn't miss it much.Q. Did you feel Indian or a sense of Indianness?A. To the contrary. On one of the night passes, I dimmed the lights in the flight deck and saw the stars. When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land but from the solar system. I could extend the whole thing-maybe one day people will go to other galaxies and then what would we say? Where did we come from? I am a resident of the Milky Way?Q. What exactly happened during the Spartan satellite release manoeuvre? What malfunctioned?A. We don't know about the malfunction part. NASA is looking into all these things. It isn't one big thing but a number of small things that made us get to where we were at the end.Q. Were you hurt by some of the reports in the Indian media that blamed you?A. I just haven't had the time to look at the reports. But NASA did not blame me at all. I wasn't hurt because I figured that in the end everyone would know what the truth was.Q. What was your immediate feeling when things went wrong?A. At that time, one is so busy and focused on the task that one doesn't feel anything. My immediate feeling was that we had 13 more days to go, with plenty of experiments that had nothing to do with the satellite. This included a space walk. And we had to focus on our mission and make the best of it.Q. When you returned, what was the first thing you wanted to do?A. I wanted to go on a canoeing trip and feel the wind in my face. That's one thing you miss when you're out there. I missed the fresh air."

"The Maharashtra government's proposal to transfer tribal land in Palghar to iPhone manufacturer Foxconn has sparked protests by locals.

A government official said Foxconn will be more interested in this location due to its proximity to Mumbai.","Summarise: The Maharashtra government is considering handing over tribal land in Palghar, near Mumbai, to the Taiwanese firm Foxconn, which has committed to invest $5 billion in the state, sparking protests.The land is part of 2,766 hectares acquired in the mid-1960s as part of an ambitious plan for a dairy project to supply 1.25 lakh litres of milk a day to Mumbai. This plan was a non-starter for various reasons and the land was lying unclaimed, with some of the original owners continuing to farm their plots.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, has constituted a committee under the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) chief to study how much of this land can be set aside for industries.State chief secretary Sumit Mullick said, ?Yes, there is a proposal to transfer some of the dairy land at Dapchari to MIDC.

"FasoPro, a startup based in African nation Burkina Faso creates products like salted cakes and pepper chips with protein-rich caterpillar powder to tackle malnutrition. The caterpillars, which feed on the leaves of shea trees, are made up of more than 60% protein. The startup was founded by Kahitouo Hien, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley in 2011.","Summarise: Small black cylinders simmer in two pots, emitting a pungent and smoky smell.This is not someone?s kitchen, however. It is the offices of agrifood company FasoPro, which double as a caterpillar laboratory.Kahitouo Hien walks hastily from one room to another, his T-shirt bearing an unusual slogan: ?Small caterpillars, big pleasure.??Caterpillars are made up of more than 60% protein,? says Hien. ?They are among the most nutritious foods available in Burkina Faso.?According to the World Food Programme, acute malnutrition in Burkina Faso stands at 10.4%.Poor harvests, caused by drought, mean there is a lack of food and diverse nutrients in the country. Hien aims to change that. In 2015, he set up an improvised laboratory in Ouagadougou to industrialise the production of shea caterpillars ? insects that feed on the leaves of shea trees.Traditionally eaten in many parts of Burkina Faso, caterpillars are now sold at markets throughout the country as a tasty treat. But no one had thought of industrialising their production until now, says Hien.Hien decided to start his business while studying engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2011. ?I wrote a business plan on caterpillars because I?ve been eating them since childhood,? he says. Hien?s tutor encouraged him to take part in the university?s global social venture competition, and he went on to win the prize for best social startup in 2012. Armed with the prize and his degree, Hien worked on developing his business for two years before finally selling his first caterpillars to market traders.?It didn?t start off well,? he recalls. ?Our price ? 3,000 Central African francs (about Â£4) for one 500g pack of fresh caterpillars ? was just too high.?He came up with a solution the day his steriliser broke down. ?Bags of fresh caterpillars were piling up and the insects were drying out,? Hien said. ?We had to find a way to shift them.? In January 2016, he launched a new product: dried caterpillars. At 650 francs (85p) for a 70g pack, the crunchy caterpillars were an instant hit. ?We sold 30,000 units last year, and hope to hit 100,000 this year,? he says.Yelo Kam, one of his six employees, meticulously cuts labels for caterpillar bags. ?Kahitouo is an ambitious man, a visionary,? she says, without lifting her eyes from her work. ?You have to be brave to hang in there.?Hien?s venture was given ?42,000 (Â£36,000) in 2016 after winning a French competition that rewards social initiatives. ?The money will allow us to attend regional fairs, as well as to find markets and partners in west Africa,? he says.Hien still pursues his first passion: research. For several months, his team has been working on ways to breed caterpillars in a controlled environment, rather than in nature.?Once mature, caterpillars normally hide in the ground to grow ? a stage that is only possible in porous soil,? Hien explains. ?Yet with soils drying up, caterpillars are becoming rarer.?While initial results are encouraging, the company needs more funds to finish its research, but the road ahead does not scare Hien. ?I like taking risks. Challenges spur me on.? And he?s already thinking of his next prototype: a cricket biscuit."
"Filmmaker Shyam Benegal said the media should question Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Minister Smriti Irani on what happened to the report submitted by the special committee, which he heads, for reforming the Censor Board. Benegal added, ""Why haven't they taken any action on the proposed changes?"" The report had suggested that board should not impose censoring but only certify movies.","Summarise: In the wake of recent controversies where several filmmakers have locked horns with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a fresh debate has been triggered by filmmaker Shyam Benegal meeting with the officials at the Information & Broadcasting Ministry. The filmmaker met the ministry officials to check the status of the report submitted by a special committee led by him in 2016, which suggested that CBFC should limit its functioning to issuing certificates to movies and not impose censoring.While Benegal is hopeful that government will push the much required revamping of the CBFC and introduce changes in the archaic Cinematograph Act 1952, we contacted him to for clarity on any deadline given by the ministry. He tells us, ?We submitted the report in two parts?in April and October last years?and they are yet to take any action. I?ve been after them for the last 10 days but I can?t talk much because I have sworn to maintain the confidentiality of the subject until the ministry itself reacts.?He adds, ?I?d urge you to get in touch with the Joint Secretary or the secretary of the ministry or even the minister Ms. Smriti Irani and ask them what happened to the report and why haven?t they taken any action on the proposed changes.?The committee has proposed amendments such as introducing a new category called ?adult with caution? and sub-dividing existing categories into UA 12+ and UA 15+ to make the content accessible to appropriate audience. If we don?t have a rating system in between UA and A, we will suggest cuts otherwise we can?t certify.Reacting to the points mentioned in the report, Pahlaj Nihalani, CBFC chairman says, ?What the Shyam Benegal report says, I don?t agree with that because he?s not demanding the right things. If we don?t have a rating system in between UA and A, so definitely we will suggest them cuts otherwise we can?t certify [the film].?With an underlined sarcasm, Nihalani adds, ?A wrong interpretation by some unknowledgeable people that CBFC is just a certification body, as along with that there?s an act and rulebook also, which you can?t forget.?While all this is still being debated upon, we asked film frat if it?s about time that censor board should be revamped and new changed be introduced.If certification is specifically categorized, audience can self-censor  what they?d like to consumeStating that it?s ?pathetically regressive? to have an appointed board deciding on creative cuts, filmmaker Homi Adajania opines, ?It?s bizarre that some pseudo-intellectual diktat can be passed allowing a screen kiss to linger for six seconds but not eight! What happens in those two seconds? It?s all just so freaking backward.? He adds, ?If certification is specifically categorized, audience can self-censor what they?d like to consume, knowing what the film?s rating stands for and through this they will not be offended by the content.?Director Ruchi Narain, whose animated film Hanuman ?Da Damdaar faced censorship issues, quips, ?It?s the simple truth. Government should govern. Reporters should report. Film makers should make films. Certification board should certify. If you start censoring everything, you turn blank and have nothing to say.?Ruling out any possibility that Bollywood can ever be free from censorship, filmmaker Hansal Mehta says it?s sad that there?s no will to actually bring about a change. ?I heard about this draft for a bill being proposed, which will be studied by the cabinet. But when will it be tabled in the Parliament? When will it actually go through?? asks Mehta.We?ll have to push our artistic boundaries in a way that we can work within the guidelines and parameters of CBFC?Every time there a furor around a film, there?s some spoken gesture that comes through but there?s no action. I have this sinking feeling that we?ll have to live with censorship that has existed since CBFC came into existence and Cinematograph Act was formed in 1952. So, we?ll have to push our artistic boundaries in a way that we can work within the guidelines and parameters of CBFC,? he adda.In support of Shyam Benegal committee report, film critic Omar Qureshi says, ?Censorship rules and regulations are as archaic as it gets and these new recommendations are an upgradation on the lines of the American association that has PG13 and PG18 and ?approved for all audiences? as per guidelines set for movies depending upon language and adult and violence quotient. And in any case, the word ?censor? is wrong. The body was always meant to guide and certify. Never censor. It reduces the freedom of expression to naught. Words like censorship are used in non democratic countries. Not in our great grey democracy.?Follow @htshowbiz for more"

Ravi Kumar, who worked with Kotak Mahindra died on Monday, two days after Prem Singh jabbed him in Sadar Bazaar, where the bank branch was. Prem was paid Rs 1.5 lakh for the hit by a friend, Anish Yadav, who claimed to be in love with Kumar?s wife, police said.?We haven?t received any theft report but if the police are investigating, we will fully cooperate with them,? Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS, said.Singh was with his cousin, who was to undergo a surgery at AIIMS, when he heard two doctors discuss the side effects of the anaesthesia. It gave him the idea that an injection could be used to murder Kumar and make a quick buck, a source said. When the cousin was called for a pre-surgery check-up on December 27, Singh stole a bottle of Midazolam, an anaesthetic, from the hospital, police sources said.Singh told police he had planned to use only Midazolam, thinking Kumar would die of a drug overdose. But, he wanted a foolproof plan. He searched on the Net for drugs which in combination with Midazolam could be fatal. He zeroed on Fortwin, an opioid used to treat pain, and Phenergan, which is used to treat allergy symptoms. He and Yadav bought the drugs and two masks from a chemist. Police, who are waiting for the post-mortem report, have contacted AIIMS and have sought assistance in the investigation. Yadav and Ravi?s wife were dating in college but the woman ended the relationship when he was arrested on charges of rape, sources said. Ravi Kumar married in July."

"The world's eight richest people together own assets worth $426 billion, equivalent to the wealth owned by world's poorest 50%, according to a report by charitable organisation Oxfam. Microsoft's Bill Gates is the world's richest person followed by Zara's Amancio Ortega and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The report attributed wealth inequality to aggressive wage restraint and tax dodging.","Summarise: The world?s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe?s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth.In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was ?beyond grotesque? that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (Â£350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people.The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump?s victory in the US presidential election.Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation.Oxfam said the world?s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway.The others are Carlos Slim HelÃº: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service.Last year, Oxfam said the world?s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world?s population. However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor.With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the Chinese president Xi Jinping, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations.Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF?s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd. The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an ?iron law of capitalism?, but a matter of making the right policy choices.The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, ?attesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress?.Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world?s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added.?From Brexit to the success of Donald Trump?s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,? the report said.The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population.Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: ?This year?s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before. It is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity. ?While one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight, a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes to spend it. The fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.?Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: ?Once again Oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.?The Oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. It said that over the next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1tn to their heirs ? a sum larger than the annual GDP of India, a country with 1.3 billion people. Between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10% increased by just $65, while the incomes of the richest 1% grew by $11,800 ? 182 times as much.Oxfam called for fundamental change to ensure that economies worked for everyone, not just ?a privileged few?.

This is far south of where India and Bhutan mark the trijunction, which the map acknowledged with a dotted line.The area on the Doklam plateau south of the dotted line is claimed by China, and it is here that Beijing was building a road into what Bhutan sees as its territory, triggering the stand-off with Bhutan and India.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday: ""The line commences at Mount Gipmochi on the Bhutan frontier, and follows the above-mentioned water-parting to the point where it meets Nepal territory.

The figure is expected to rise to three times during the next phase of the study to be conducted on inferior road stretches.The study, commissioned in May, released its preliminary findings last week involving a Sports Utility Vehicle with a mileage of 10 -12 km/litre. Subsequent tests will be conducted with small cars and loaded and empty trucks. The findings use a three-tier grading system to assess road conditions. Traffic congestion is also a parameter.The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI) conducted the study. It was found that an SUV consumed about 40.25 millilitres of fuel per kilometre when it travelled on the Noida Expressway, considered a good, fuel-efficient road. The same vehicle consumed about 95.5 millilitres of fuel for every kilometre when travelling from Noida Expressway to Kalindi Kunj and onto Jasola.The consumption was even higher at 137.2 millilitres per km when the vehicle travelled from Botanical Garden to Kailash Hospital in Noida. ?The initial findings of the study conducted on two road stretches in Delhi have revealed that Delhiites could be consuming at least two-to-three times more fuel because of bad quality roads and traffic conditions,? said Ravindra Kumar, principal scientist of CRRI?s transport and planning division.?The result is they end up paying more.?A preliminary estimate puts the wastage across India at Rs 960 crore a day.

"Chemicals found in traditional Chinese medicines may be used to make next generation contraceptives, dubbed ""molecular condoms"", scientists say. Chemicals extracted from two plants, thunder god vine and aloe, were found to effectively prevent fertilisation. The chemicals have no adverse effect on egg or sperm, and could serve as a safe alternative to hormone-based contraceptives, scientists added.","Summarise: Los Angeles, May 16 (PTI) Chemicals found in Chinese folk medicines may be used to make next generation of molecular condoms that may serve as a safe alternative to todays hormone-based contraceptives, scientists say. The chemicals, extracted from two plants, thunder god vine and aloe, are effective at low doses and have no adverse effect on egg or sperm, other than preventing a key step in fertilisation - the meeting of egg and sperm. They work by stopping sperms power kick, which is normally stimulated by the hormone progesterone secreted by cells surrounding the egg and makes the sperms tail whip forcefully to propel it toward and into the egg. According to researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley in the US, the chemicals may serve as an emergency contraceptive taken either before or after intercourse, or as a permanent contraceptive via a skin patch or vaginal ring. Human sperm take about five to six hours to mature once they enter the female reproductive system, which is enough time for the drug to enter the system and block the kick. Also, because the chemicals prevent fertilisation, they may be a more acceptable alternative in the eyes of those who object to emergency contraceptives that prevent the implantation of a potentially viable fertilised egg. These two plant compounds block fertilisation at very low concentrations - about 10 times lower than levels of levonorgestrel in emergency contraceptives, said Polina Lishko, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley. ""They could be a new generation of emergency contraceptive we nicknamed molecular condoms,"" said Lishko, who led the team that discovered the anti-fertility properties of the two chemicals. ""If one can use a plant-derived, non-toxic, non-hormonal compound in lesser concentration to prevent fertilisation in the first place, it could potentially be a better option,"" she said. Purusing books on natural contraceptives used by indigenous peoples around the world, researchers came across several non-steroid chemicals isolated from anti-fertility plants. One of these was pristimerin, from the plant Tripterygium wilfordii, also known as ""thunder god vine."" Leaves from the plant have been used as an antifertility drug in Chinese traditional medicine, though some compounds in the leaves are poisonous. It has also been used as a folk remedy for rheumatoid arthritis. The other chemical was lupeol, which is found in plants such as mango and dandelion root. While it has been tested as an anticancer agent, it was not suspected of having contraceptive properties. "

""IT ministry has approved a formal agreement wherein Department of Telecommunications will obtain list maintained by INTERPOL containing domain names hosting child sexual abuse contents and act as an appropriate agency of the government to direct its licensee ISPs to expeditiously remove or disable access to material found in violation of the IT Act,"" the Centre said in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court. ""Further the mechanism to obtain the list containing domain names hosting contents of child sexual abuse is being worked out in consultation with the CBI."" The top court asked the Centre in February to suggest ways to ban child pornography in all forms in the country saying that the nation cannot ""afford to carry on any experiment"" in the name of ""liberty or freedom of speech and expression"". INTERPOL A MAJOR ASSET The SC was hearing PILs filed by Indore-based advocate Kamlesh Vaswani and Supreme Court Women Lawyers Association seeking a direction to the government to adopt various measures towards improvement in the effectiveness of blocking child pornography on the Internet and to eliminate it. RP Saxena, co-ordinator of the cyber Laws and e-security group of the government, said in the affidavit that a meeting was convened recently to seek cooperation and support from Internet Service Providers, which in turn can play an important role by blocking or disabling the lists containing domain names/URLs/website addresses hosting child pornography content. Interpol is a major source of getting access to such lists of websites containing child sexual abuse. The agency maintains a regular update of the ""worst"" of such sites. Interpol has been tasked by the UN General Assembly in 2009 to maintain and disseminate to the national central bureaus a worldwide list of URLs, which contains these websites that publish the most severe child abuse material. Ordering a crackdown against child porn, the SC had said that one needs to draw a distinct line between art and obscenity and child pornography cannot be justified in the name of freedom of speech and expression."

"Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh on Sunday announced that ambulance service for cows will be started in 10 districts of the state over the next few months.

The Uttar Pradesh government announced a similar service, as did a particular district in Madhya Pradesh over the last year. Raman Singh did not elaborate on how much the scheme will cost.On Sunday, Singh urged people to use panchagavya ? a concoction prepared by mixing constituents derived directly and indirectly from cows such as dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee ? and help promote the cow-based economy. ?Organic farming and biogas can help promote a cow-based economy,? Singh said. Singh had in April said that anyone found killing cows in Chhattisgarh will be hanged, suggesting a radical shift in plans to protect the bovine.Under the Chhattisgarh Pashu Krurata Adhiniyam, cow slaughter and transporting beef is banned. Anyone found guilty faces up to seven years in jail and a fine of Rs 50,000 or both."

"Pakistan's interim Prime Minister nominee Shahid Abbasi, who most recently served as the country's Petroleum Minister, faces an inquiry over corruption in an over ?13,000-crore LNG (Liquefied natural gas) contract. Abbasi is accused of misusing his authority and causing a potential loss of ?12,000 crore to the national exchequer over 15 years.","Summarise: By Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Jul 31 (PTI) The ruling PML-N partys interim prime minister nominee Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is facing a Rs 220 billion corruption inquiry by Pakistans National Accountability Bureau over an LNG contract, according to a media report. Abbasi, the former minister for petroleum and natural resources, is the principal accused in a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) case registered in 2015 over the award of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import contract, Dawn News reported. Other suspects in the case include former petroleum secretary Abid Saeed, Inter State Gas Systems (ISGS) managing director Mobin Saulut, private firm Engros chief executive officer Emranul Haq and the Sui Southern Gas Companys (SSGC) ex-MD Zuhair Ahmed Siddiqui, the report said. Abbasi is expected to be elected as the new prime minister by Pakistans Parliament tomorrow, replacing ousted premier Nawaz Sharif. The Supreme Court on Friday disqualified 67-year-old Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing the embattled leader out of office. After Sharifs disqualification, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) nominated Abbasi as its candidate for the prime ministers post for an interim period before Punjab Chief Minister and Nawazs brother Shehbaz Sharif replaces him for the remaining 10 months of the governments term. According to NAB documents, the contract for the LNG import and distribution was awarded to the Elengy Terminal, a subsidiary of Engro, in 2013 in violation of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and relevant laws. The bureau registered the case on July 29, 2015, but it is still in the inquiry stage, contrary to NAB Chairman Qamar Zaman Chaudhrys claim that he has introduced a new strategy under which the process of complaint verification, inquiry, investigation and filing of reference takes 10 months, the report said. It appears that like several cases of the Sharif family, this one has also been dumped by the NAB, it said. The case was registered on the complaint of Shahid Sattar, an energy expert and former member of the Planning Commission and the SSGC board of directors, along with others, accusing Abbasi of misusing his authority and causing a potential USD 2 billion loss to the national exchequer in 15 years. The NAB documents said that it had been recommended that the names of all accused in the case, including that of Abbasi, should be placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) and the process was ongoing, the report said.

According to an official of the science and technology ministry, with the funds provided by the tourism ministry, a cafeteria, facilities like public convenience and garbage recycling units will be created in two gardens. ?The tourism ministry will allocate ?10 and four crore for Roshanara Bagh and Qudsia Bagh, respectively, for their beautification, upkeep of monuments, cafeteria, playgrounds, benches, dustbins and garbage recycling units.

Shaped like a handheld card swipe machine, the new device is used on random passengers coming to Delhi?s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA). Since passengers spend considerable time before the security check at the airport, the CISF stops passengers on a random basis just after they enter the terminal building. Based on profiling, they were taken to a separate enclosure and ETD check was carried on. The device is passed through the baggage and hands of passengers and through colours, it can tell whether the person has packed explosive or any such item. Since passengers and their bags are not checked till they reach the security point, through ETD checks, the CISF wants to ensure better security at the check-in area.Read: Bomb alert! How Delhi airport security failed to detect ?explosives? in a bag?Now, we have an improved version of the device. It can penetrate into the bag and check if there is any trace of any explosive.

While our staff is highly trained, through better use of technology we try to minimise terror-related incident,? said an official of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).Officials said there will be some trace of the explosive on a person?s hand if he has touched it before coming to the airport. At Delhi airport, the CISF has separate enclosures just after the entry gate and passengers with suspicious activities are taken there. ?First their baggage is scanned, then they are frisked and then check with ETD is conducted. The handheld device is quite handy and we have about a dozen of them. They are easy to carry and success rate is also very good,? the official added.The CISF is also planning to use handheld ETD to check passengers with artificial limb so that they do not have to go through the trauma of removing it during security check. Usually ETD is used to check the prosthetic limbs but the CISF says it is meant only for detection of explosives and there is always a chance that a person may try to use prosthetic limb to hide a weapon or for smuggling. Now, the CISF has requested for an upgraded version of ETD so that passengers don?t have to go through the trauma of removing it."

The CIC said since the information is more than 20 years old, it cannot be withheld.","Summarise: New Delhi, Feb 17 (PTI) The statement of Nathuram Godse, along with other relevant records related to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, should be ""proactively disclosed"" on the website of the National Archives, the CIC has ruled. Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said, ""One may disagree with Nathuram Godse and his co-accused but we cannot refuse disclosure or circulation of his opinion. ""At the same time, neither Nathuram Godse nor the holder of his theme or opinion can go to the extent of killing a person whose philosophy he cannot agree with,"" he said in his order. Godse, a right-wing activist, had assassinated the Mahatma on January 30, 1948. Petitioner Ashutosh Bansal had demanded the charge sheet and Godses statement, among other details, from Delhi Police which forwarded the application to the National Archives of India (NAI), saying the records have been handed over to it. The National Archives asked Bansal to inspect the records and cull out the information. After failure to get the information, Bansal approached the Central Information Commissioner (CIC). Acharyulu directed the Central Public Information Commissioner (CPIO-NAI) not to charge Rs three per page for photocopying because the Right to Information Act overrides any such provision of the Public Records Act by virtue of Section 22 of the RTI Act. Although neither Delhi Police nor the National Archives cited any objection on the disclosure of the information, Acharyulu said that the information sought does not attract any of the exemption clauses. He said since the information is more than 20-years-old, it cannot be withheld unless it attracts section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act which prohibits disclosure of information that prejudicially affects security of the State or relations with foreign countries. Acharyulu said in the present case, even section 8(1)(a) does not apply as the argument that disclosure of Godses statement could lead to enmity between Hindu and Muslim communities would not apply.

"The Delhi High Court has warned two Delhi residents against feeding or sheltering stray dogs in the common area of a private property stating that dogs can ""cause fear and discomfort"" to others living there. Notably, the Supreme Court had earlier ruled that ""stray dogs have a right to live"" over a submission demanding complete elimination of stray dogs.","Summarise: New Delhi, Jul 30 (PTI) Feeding or sheltering stray dogs in the common area of a private property can cause nuisance, the Delhi High Court has said, warning two south Delhi residents to ensure that the canines do not cause fear or discomfort to others. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told the two respondents that they cannot be permitted to keep stray dogs in the common driveway of a private property which was jointly owned by others, if their neighbours did not approve. The court also said in a recent order that the two cannot feed the dogs or chain them in the driveway. The bench said it was the duty of the two ""to ensure that the stray dogs do not cause any nuisance to the other residents within the same property and in the neighbourhood"". The court noted that keeping stray dogs would ""cause fear and discomfort"" to others living or coming there ""who are not accustomed to keeping pet dogs"". ""The nuisance caused by the conduct of respondent nos.3 and 4 (the two individual respondents) in sheltering the stray dogs in the common driveway in the present case is writ large from the photographs placed on record. ""To a person, who is not accustomed to keeping pet dogs, it also causes fear and discomfort to walk into a property where stray dogs are kept either chained or let loose,"" it said. The bench said it ""rues the lack of civic sense and concern exhibited"" by the two towards their fellow inhabitants in their immediate neighbourhood. ""Their concern for the stray dogs also appears to us to be superficial and lacks commitment. Otherwise, the dogs would not have been left in such unhygienic and filthy conditions, as appear from the photographs on record,"" the bench said. It directed them to ""stop chaining, feeding or sheltering the stray dogs in the driveway of the aforesaid property. It shall also be the obligation of respondent nos.3 and 4 to ensure that the said dogs do not defecate in the driveway, and if they do so, it shall be their responsibility to clean up the same."" It directed the Station House Officer of Malviya Nagar police station, under whose jurisdiction the property fell, to ensure strict compliance of this order. The order came on the plea by one Om Prakash Saini, who jointly holds the property with the two respondents, claiming that keeping and feeding the stray dogs in the common driveway was ""causing immense nuisance and harassment for the other residents"". The court has listed the matter for further hearing on September 1. The order comes in the backdrop of a January order of the Supreme Court which categorically said ""stray dogs have a right to live."" During that hearing, the apex court had reacted sharply when a submission was made that such canines should be completely eliminated across the country. "

"Scientists have successfully removed HIV DNA from the genomes of 'humanised' mice, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool, a step which in the future may help eliminate the virus in humans. The researchers were able to genetically inactivate the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) in mice, that had been injected with human genes and cells.","Summarise: New York, May 2 (PTI) Scientists have successfully removed HIV DNA from the genomes of animals - including a humanised mice - using a powerful gene-editing tool, an advance that may help eliminate the virus in humans in future. The team is the first to demonstrate that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication can be completely shut down and the virus eliminated from infected cells in animals with a powerful gene editing technology known as CRISPR/Cas9. Researchers, including those from Temple University in the US, build on their previous study in which they used transgenic rat and mouse models with HIV-1 DNA incorporated into the genome of every tissue of the animals bodies. They demonstrated that their strategy could delete the targeted fragments of HIV-1 from the genome in most tissues in the experimental animals. The researchers genetically inactivated HIV-1 in transgenic mice, reducing the RNA expression of viral genes by roughly 60 to 95 per cent. They then tested their system in mice acutely infected with EcoHIV, the mouse equivalent of human HIV-1. In the third animal model, latent HIV-1 infection was recapitulated in humanised mice engrafted with human immune cells, including T cells, followed by HIV-1 infection. In all three animal models, the researchers utilised a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector delivery system based on a subtype known as AAV-DJ/8. ""The AAV-DJ/8 subtype combines multiple serotypes, giving us a broader range of cell targets for the delivery of our CRISPR/Cas9 system,"" said Wenhui Hu, associate professor at Temple University. Researchers also re-engineered their previous gene editing apparatus to carry a set of four guide RNAs, all designed to efficiently excise integrated HIV-1 DNA from the host cell genome and avoid potential HIV-1 mutational escape.

"Dozens of teen pregnancy prevention programs deemed ineffective by US President Donald Trump's administration will lose over $200 million in funding following a surprise decision to end five-year grants after only three years. US government officials said only four of 37 programs studied showed lasting positive impacts. Critics urged the government ""not to turn back the clock"" on progress.","Summarise: Dozens of teen pregnancy prevention programs deemed ineffective by President Donald Trump?s administration will lose more than $200 million in funding following a surprise decision to end five-year grants after only three years.The administration?s assessment is in sharp contrast with that of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which credited the program with contributing to an all-time low rate of teen pregnancies.Rachel Fey of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said Tuesday that grantees under the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program were given no explanation when notified this month their awards will end next June. The program, begun under President Barack Obama?s administration, receives about $100 million a year.?We know so little about the rationale behind cutting short these grants,? said Fey, who said the teen birth rate has fallen by about 40 percent nationally since the program went into effect in 2010. The focus of the program is on evidence-based interventions aimed at preventing teen pregnancy. It does not pay for or provide contraceptives.A Health and Human Services spokesman said late Tuesday that an evaluation of the first round of grants released last fall found only four of 37 programs studied showed lasting positive impacts. Most of the other programs had no effect or were harmful, the department said, including three that it said increased the likelihood that teens would have unprotected sex and become pregnant.?Given the very weak evidence of positive impact of these programs, the Trump administration, in its ... 2018 budget proposal, did not recommend continued funding for the TPP program,? the department statement said.The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists urged the administration ?not to turn back the clock? on progress.?It?s as though the evidence and the facts don?t matter,? ACOG President Dr. Haywood Brown said.The North Texas Alliance to Reduce Unintended Pregnancy in Teens, one of more than 80 current grantees around the country, will lose just under $1 million a year, about three-quarters of its budget, Executive Director Terry Goltz Greenberg said.

The grant provided about half of the organization?s annual budget. As recently as July 3, people from the organization had been working with HHS officials about the details of the program, said Meagan Downey, the group?s director of special projects. The grant covered about half of her salary.Downey said her organization was one of five grant recipients nationwide that lost their funding immediately. Others were given until July 1, 2018 to prepare for the loss of the funds.Leaders of the HOPE Buffalo program always had an eye toward establishing partnerships with city and community leaders that would enable its work to continue beyond the five-year lifespan of the grant, which provided $2 million a year, Project Director Stan Martin said. With less time and less funding, he said, ?our efforts were just accelerated.?"

"Delhi reported a rape every five hours in 2016, but the total number of cases marginally declined to 2,029, as against 2,069 last year, the city police's data has shown. However, only 1,744 (86%) of the registered cases were solved. Further, a molestation case was registered every three hours, taking the number of such cases to 4,005, this year.","Summarise: Crime marginally reduced this year in Delhi compared to the last year with only motor vehicle theft registering an increase over the previous year. Latest annual crime data by the Delhi Police shows that cases of molestation (from 5,328 to 4,005) and robbery (from 7,141 to 4,538) showed the maximum dip. However, Delhi reported a rape every four hours in 2016. Compared to last year?s 2,069 rape cases, 2029 were registered this year.

FIRs registered across Delhi ? increased by 8.88% than last year?s 1.81 lakh to 1.97 lakh this year. Robbery cases registered a sharp decline of 35.45%.

Between November 8 and December 9 this year - a month of demonetisation ? there were 315 robbery cases compared to 561 in the same period last year. ?The drop in robbery cases would have been less than 35.45% but because of demonetisation the cases reported a sharp decline since November 8.

Read: Missing JNU student to ghostbuster?s death: 5 crimes that foxed Delhi in 2016The numbers of murders too decreased from 530 to 490 cases this year, but a few sensational murders kept the police on their toes. The triple murder of a man, his wife and son at their house in central Delhi?s Rajender Nagar on January 10 was one among them. In November, the discovery of three mutilated bodies in 10 days, within a radius of 10 kilometres in south Delhi triggered fears of a serial killer. Police have solved two cases but are yet to make any headway in the third case. The Delhi Police was also surrounded by controversies throughout the year. It began with their decision to book JNU student leaders under the archaic sedition law. It snowballed into a controversy forcing then police commissioner to admit that ?excesses were committed from both sides (police and JNU students).? Facing heat and protests, the police chief also said that cops would not oppose the bail of JNU students, only to retract later. One crime that the police failed to keep bring down this year is the theft of vehicles. As many as 5,250 more vehicles were stolen this year than the last year, taking total such cases to 36,137. Police say they are meeting with their counterparts in Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to bring down the motor vehicle thefts. Prashant Vihar in outer Delhi, which registered the highest snatching cases, topped the list in areas where most vehicles (920) were stolen, followed by Bhajanpura (630).

"An Airbnb host who cancelled a woman's reservation as she was Asian has been fined ?3 lakh for racial discrimination and ordered to take a course in Asian-American studies. Homestay startup Airbnb also permanently banned the host after the incident was reported. ""I wouldn?t rent it to u if u were the last person on earth,? the host told her.","Summarise: An Airbnb host who canceled a woman?s reservation using a racist remark has been ordered to pay $5,000 in damages for racial discrimination and take a course in Asian American studies.Dyne Suh, a 26-year-old law clerk, had booked Tami Barker?s mountain cabin in Big Bear, California, for a skiing weekend with friends in February, but Barker canceled the reservation by text message minutes before they arrived,stating: ?I wouldn?t rent it to u if u were the last person on earth? and ?One word says it all. Asian?.This is the first time an Airbnb host has been penalized for racial discrimination under a landmark agreement between the San Francisco-headquartered accommodation marketplace and the California department of fair employment and housing (DFEH), announced earlier this year. The agreement allows the regulator to test and penalize Airbnb hosts for racial bias. In addition to paying monetary damages and taking a college-level course in Asian American studies, Barker must agree to comply with anti-discrimination laws, make a personal apology to Suh, participate in a community education panel and volunteer with a civil rights organization.?We were thinking pretty creatively with this agreement,? said Kevin Kish, director of DFEH. ?The law tends to be backwards-looking, focusing on compensating people for harm. We?re interested in remedies that repair harm and transform relationships.?Suh booked Barker?s place for a long weekend with her fiance in February 2017 a month in advance for $250 a night. When Suh later asked if it was OK to bring two friends and two dogs along, Barker said it was fine but the group would need to pay an additional $50 a night, according to screenshots of their text messages. On the day of the booking, the foursome drove for hours in the rain and snow to Big Bear. Minutes away from the house, Suh texted Barker to let them know they were close and to confirm the cost of the stay. According to Suh, Barker then denied she ever agreed to having two extra guests and canceled the reservation, despite Suh sending her screenshots of their earlier agreement.When Suh said she?d complain to Airbnb about the racist remark, Barker replied: ?It?s why we have Trump ? and I will not allow this country to be told what to do by foreigners.?In an emotional video immediately after the incident, Suh said: ?I just feel so hurt. People thought: ?Oh, with the election of President Obama racism is over in this country.? No, it?s very much alive, it exists and it could happen to anyone.??It stings that after living in the US for over 23 years this is what happens. No matter if I follow the law ... no matter how well I treat others, it doesn?t matter. If you?re Asian, you?re less than human and people can treat you like trash.?After Suh complained, Airbnb carried out its own investigation and banned Barker from the platform.Suh also complained to DFEH, leading to a separate investigation, mediation and an agreement between the two parties, negotiated last week. The idea of making the host attend the Asian American studies course came out during mediation sessions. ?A lot of times when we see bias incidents it involves a lack of understanding of the experiences and histories of a particular group of people,? Kish said. ?This was a creative way to address that core underlying cause of the bias.??We want there to be strong anti-discrimination protections and preventions of harm, but we recognize that the world isn?t divided into good guys and bad guys. Humans have biases and we also need to recognize that humans change.?Barker?s lawyer Edward Lee said in a statement that his client was ?regretful for her impetuous actions and comments? but pleased to have resolved the matter with Suh and the DFEH ?in a manner that can hopefully bring a positive outcome out of an unfortunate incident?.Airbnb allowed the DFEH to regulate it for racial bias following a 10-month investigation based on a growing number of reports suggesting hosts regularly refuse to rent to guests due to their race, a problem exposed in 2016 under the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack.Until that point, Airbnb, like other ?sharing economy? companies including Uber and Instacart, had repeatedly resisted industry regulations, arguing that it was a ?platform? and not subject to local laws and requirements that apply to similar businesses. Under the agreement, Airbnb allows the government to test for racial discrimination by hosts in California who have been subject to discrimination complaints and have three or more listings. The ?fair housing testing? echoes the process DFEH investigators have used in the traditional rental market where black and white applicants, with otherwise identical backgrounds, are both sent to try and secure a lease from a landlord. With Airbnb, investigators can set up fake accounts and make reservation requests to hosts to see if they are discriminating. Kish hopes that this first case will send a message to hosts: ?We?re watching,? he said. ?But we?re willing to be creative.? ?We are interested in facilitating the types of outcomes that allow people to not only be compensated for harm but transform their relationships with each other and their communities.?Airbnb did not respond to a request for comment.

"The Noida traffic police on Sunday trained 20 civilian volunteers on road safety rules to assist them in regulating traffic. The police had earlier appealed to residents through social networking sites to help them reduce vehicular congestion and around 40 residents extended their support. The volunteers will work during peak traffic hours at intersections, markets, and roads.  ","Summarise: The Noida traffic police imparted road safety training to 20 volunteers on Sunday who will assist them in reducing vehicular congestion and curbing traffic violations in their respective residential areas.Earlier in June, the traffic police had appealed to residents through social networking sites to assist them in reducing traffic congestion. Residents? welfare associations were also roped in to encourage residents to be a part of the initiative.Officials said that the volunteers will also be given reflector jackets for their safety and identification. The volunteers will mostly have to perform their duty during the peak hour when there is a high volume of traffic on city roads.On Sunday, the superintendent of police (traffic), Anil Kumar Jha interacted with the traffic volunteers at his office in Sector 14A and briefed them on their role. He assured them all assistance from the traffic police for regulating traffic movement on city roads.He also made them aware of the major traffic problems in Noida and sought their cooperation to curb them.

"British F1 driver Lewis Hamilton gave up on a third place finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix to let his teammate Valtteri Bottas finish third instead. Hamilton, who was fourth placed, asked Mercedes to tell Bottas to let him through to chase down the leading Ferraris, agreeing to give the third place back if he fails to overtake them.","Summarise: The Hungarian Grand Prix could yet stand as one of the defining moments of the 2017 Formula One season.Under the unyielding sun of a Budapest summer the two title protagonists, who have been equally unforgiving on track in a battle that has swayed gloriously between them, finally showed their hands as to how that fight would proceed in the second half of the season.Sebastian Vettel won what was hardly a classic race but Lewis Hamilton, in standing by his team-mate, admitted he might have dropped points that could ultimately cost him the world championship.Vettel won at the Hungaroring with an impressive drive from pole position. That he did so while nursing a damaged steering wheel made it all the more of an achievement but also put the Scuderia on the spot.His team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was quicker on track but they chose not to order Vettel to allow him to pass. That the German is their only title contender could not have been clearer.In their wake Hamilton was on a charge and in turn faster than his team?mate Valtteri Bottas. With passing at the Hungaroring all but impossible this year, he asked Mercedes to tell Bottas to let him through to chase down the leading Ferraris, agreeing that he would give the place back should he fail to overtake them. Bottas let him through and, unable to pass Raikkonen and seven seconds up the road from his team-mate, Hamilton duly gave back the place on the final lap. Raikkonen held second, with Bottas in third and Hamilton fourth.The British driver now trails Vettel by 14 points in the world championship and ceding the place cost him three. With the title fight likely to go to the wire it might yet prove to have been the sportsmanlike gesture that could deny him a fourth drivers? title this year.?I want to win the championship the right way,? he said. ?I don?t know whether that will come back to bite me on the backside or not but I said at the beginning of the year, I want to win it the right way. I do think today was the right way to do things.?Ferrari have a long history of imposing team orders and designating a No1 driver but the Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, agreed with Hamilton and drew a stark comparison with how his team and the Scuderia went racing.?We have seen the backlash from decisions that were ruthless and cold blooded and the effect that it had on the brand,? he said. ?You could say: ?Screw it, it still won them the championship, who cares? They are in the history books.? But I do not think that is the right spin and if the purpose of us being here is to do the right things and win in the right way ? sometimes doing it the right way and standing by your values is tough and it was today, believe me.?Giving the place back was no easy feat. Bottas was only just in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and there was a real danger the manoeuvre could have cost Hamilton two places. The team had debated whether it should be done but were clear Hamilton was not instructed to do so and that he was merely sticking to his word.?It was very sportsmanlike behaviour,? said Wolff, who also acknowledged that it could cost Hamilton the title. ?These values won us six championships and it will make us win more championships in years to come. It cost us three points and could cost us the championship and we are perfectly conscious of that. But in terms of how the drivers and this team operates, we stick to what we say and if the consequences are as much as losing the championship, then we will take it.?There was little doubt that Vettel deserved the 25 points, both he and Raikkonen having a pace advantage in the early stage over Mercedes. But he revealed he was wrestling with his damaged car from the off. ?I felt there was something not right on the grid and for the formation lap the steering wheel was not straight,? he said.?Then it got worse and towards the end of the stint it was more difficult. We spoke on the radio about it and I was told to avoid the kerbs but on this track you use them on every corner, so you lose speed. It was good that it is tricky to overtake here. It felt like a very long race.?Ferrari have not won the constructors? championship since 2008 and have not taken the drivers? title since Raikkonen claimed it in 2007. Their step forward to go head-to head with Mercedes this season gives them a real opportunity to end the drought.Raikkonen might have been passed by Hamilton, which would have cost them constructor points, but they opted to gamble on the British driver being unable to do so. It paid off and they can consider their strategy a success but it indicated that they were willing to risk the team championship in favour of backing Vettel for the title.Maurizio Arrivabene, Ferrari?s team principal, praised Raikkonen for being a ?true team player? and Sergio Marchionne, the Ferrari chief executive, admitted the result had come as a relief. ?It was a much?needed win,? he said. ?The great thing is we earned it, this was a tough, tough race and we almost lost it and we got it back.?Vettel holds the lead going into the summer break and he has earned it but Hamilton can also rest easy knowing that he held an honourable line in Hungary. ?The team were in a difficult position but I think today really shows, hopefully, that I am a man of my word,? he said."

In fact, it's been on the verge of a catastrophic breakdown for quite some time now, with big-ticket companies looking to both hand over pink slips to incumbent employees as well as hire less talent. Nearly 2 lakh jobs are said to be at stake. The fact that a number of these pink slips are apparently being handed over to employees on short notice catching them completely off-guard makes matters worse.In one such incidence, a Bengaluru-based Tech Mahindra employee was reportedly asked - or rather instructed - to hang his boots as part of the company's restructuring plans. He was literally instructed by an HR manager to put in his papers the next morning or else face the axe. Now on a regular day, and inside an IT company, one would expect an employee to be given a fair amount of time to look for alternatives. Only, this wasn't the case at Tech Mahindra.

"Instagram Co-founder Mike Krieger revealed that the one thing he would've done differently was realising that founders have to ""be willing to disrupt"" themselves and get comfortable with making changes to their product. Krieger added he would have hired people faster as they lost ""so much sleep in the early days...it took a toll on our health and, probably, relationships.""","Summarise: We [Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger] both went to Stanford and at that point we knew we wanted to do something entrepreneurial. I hadn?t had that idea before coming to California but you?re surrounded by so many people there that have an entrepreneurial venture. It?s in the water, it?s in the air, and it?s very inspiring. I think Kevin was interested in entrepreneurship from an even earlier age. He was one of those high schoolers doing odds and ends to try to make a company.When we reconnected after university, we were both interested in building products that help people connect and tell their story, although we didn?t know what our product would be. We both quit our jobs because we knew we wanted to pursue something; it took about nine months until we found out what that thing actually was. We just get on really well, it?s seven years into the business and we?re still very close. We?re good friends, but we?re not best friends. I think if we were best friends it would be messier because we?ve spent so much time with each other [on the business]. Also, we balance each other out, there are times when I?m very stressed and he?s very calm, and vice versa. We can be each other?s therapists at some points.We also have very complementary skills. I bring a lot of the technology and engineering side; he brings a lot of product sense and design. He was also great at working with investors and today he is great at working across the different departments at Facebook [Instagram was sold to Facebook in 2012 for $1bn]. I like to go focus on the technology side a bit more. It works because we don?t want each other?s jobs. For us, one of the key things was being able to demonstrate, if not global traction, at least initial interest. We?d built this product called Burbn, which was the predecessor to Instagram [Burbn was a location check-in app that also allowed users to share photos, which proved to be its most popular feature]. I think the way we were able to raise financing on that product [Burbn secured $500,000 in seed funding] is that we had a couple of hundred people using it and some were really passionate about it, those user stories were really key.Investors have a mental check list of all the different risks a product might face: founder risk (are they the right founders?), execution risk, market risk. You need to remove some of those impediments from investors minds as early as possible by getting a product out there. From doing that you learn and you are able to say: ?Look, this isn?t just a hope and a dream, this is something we?ve already put out to a couple of hundred people.? I think that made a lot of difference in raising financing.There have been a couple ... even in the last year and a half you?ve seen our product go through a major evolution. It sounds like a silly example, but going from square to non-square photos was actually a big deal. Then we changed the feed, and then added Stories [an Instagram feature that launched in 2016, which allows a user to give an overview of their day, or an event, by pulling together videos and photos into a short clip].Sometimes the most resistance [to changing the product] comes from your own staff. It?s not because they?re conservative, but because change is scary ? it feels like driving a car that could go off a cliff. That?s where Instagram still being founder-led makes a big difference. We can say: ?Just take the leap of faith with us. We?re going to make this change and, if we?re wrong, we can roll it back.? There are few decisions you could make that could totally tank the company. We?ve learned that when the decision feels really hard it doesn?t necessarily mean it?s the right one, but it means we?re taking the right kind of risk.There was so much lost sleep in the early days and it took a toll on our healthI think the ability to make things is super important. I?ve met a fair amount of people who have an incredible idea for an app, and that?s great, but it?s even better when paired with the ability to prototype it. Today there are lots of resources around for building apps. Acquire those skills as early as possible, and develop them.Once we got to Facebook we had to enter a growth phase from being a 13-person company to a team of hundreds. Every six months we have a big meeting where we get everybody together to talk about the next six months. I remember one meeting where we screened a video showing the impact Instagram was having across the world. I looked around and everybody was so proud to have created that and to work on it, that was really special. At some point you have to be ready to let go of being the one person working on a business. The fact that we?ve been able to make that transition means a lot. Firstly, create a business profile. With that entrepreneurs are able to access analytics and insights about their audience [such as what time of the day they are using Instagram]. We?ve learned the value of data to Instagram, so we want to bring that to other people. Secondly, entrepreneurs should use a variety of different Instagram tools to tell their story, using their Instagram feed, but also experimenting with Stories and even posting live. They can use this to bring their audience along with them and let them view their business a new way, whether that?s behind the scenes or to an event. I would have hired much faster. There was so much lost sleep in the early days and it took a toll on our health and, probably, our relationships. It also took us a while to get comfortable with making big changes to the product. You have to be willing to disrupt yourself.Mike Krieger spoke at the Instagram #Wemadeit entrepreneurs breakfast.Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."

"China has 'vested interest' in helping resolve the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan, claimed an article in the state-run Chinese daily Global Times. The article claimed that because of China's $50 billion investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), it has a bigger role to play as a mediator between the two nations.","Summarise: Due to its almost USD 50 billion investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), China has a ""vested interest"" in acting as a mediator between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue, according to an article in a state-run daily.Â  Â  Â  The article published in the Global Times, a publication of the ruling Communist Party of China, suggested Beijing's latent interest in playing a bigger role in the region. Claiming that China had mediated between Myanmar and Bangladesh over the Rohingya refugees issue, the article said, ""China has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, but that doesn't mean Beijing can turn a deaf ear to the demands of Chinese enterprises in protecting their overseas investments."" ""Given the massive investment that China has made in countries along the One Belt, One Road, China now has a vested interest in helping resolve regional conflicts including the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan"", it said. China's recent mediation between Myanmar and Bangladesh over the Rohingya issue shows the increased ability of Beijing in resolving conflicts beyond its borders to maintain regional stability, the article said. CHINA AT THE CENTRE OF REGIONAL POWER SHIFT""China has been at the centre of a regional power shift, thus the country now needs to learn how to act as a stabilising force and conflict mediator in the region"", it said. There is so much to learn for China about how to play its role as a regional power at a time when the country is witnessing a boom in outbound direct investment, the article said. ""For instance, while China has the capability to resolve conflicts through mediation given its increased economic influence, the nation needs to be very prudent in dealing with other big powers, India included, in the region,"" it said. ""In fact, mediating between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue would perhaps be one of the toughest challenges facing China in dealing with regional affairs to safeguard its overseas interests"", the article said. This is perhaps the first time that Chinese official media started floating Beijing's interest in playing a mediatory role to resolve the Kashmir issue. WHAT IS CHINA'S OFFICIAL STAND?China's official stand is that the Kashmir issue left over from history should be resolved between India and Pakistan, though Beijing has been stepping up its investments in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). While China in the past has played down reports of the presence of its troops in PoK, saying that they were there to deliver humanitarian assistance, its USD 46 billion China- Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) through the disputed Gilgit and Baltistan region increased its involvement in the disputed areas. The CPEC project will link the Pakistani city of Gwadar to China's Xinjiang via a vast network of highways and railways. India has protested to China over the CPEC and is yet to name an official delegation to take part in a summit of the Belt and Road initiative, of which CPEC is a part. The summit is to be held from May 14-15. Chinese official media also referred to last month's participation of Chinese troops for the first time in the Pakistan Day parade as a sign of the Chinese military playing a role in regional stability.(WITH INPUTS FROM PTI)Also read | Is China using its One Belt One Road initiative as an alibi to meddle in Kashmir dispute?Also read | Pakistan using proxies in Jammu and Kashmir for its foreign policy goals: Top US experts"

"The Maharashtra government on Friday issued draft rules which will reportedly allow regularisation of most illegal constructions built before December 31, 2015, for a ""compounding fee"". A senior official said, ""Within six months of the rules coming into force, planning authorities will have to invite applications from owners and occupiers for consideration of cases for regularisation.""","Summarise:  The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Maharashtra government has set the ball rolling to regularise lakhs of unauthorised buildings and structures in cities across the state, including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, on the payment of a compounding fee.The state urban development department, which chief minister Devendra Fadnavis heads, on Friday issued draft rules to regularise unauthorised construction till December 31, 2015. The department has invited suggestions and objections on the rules in a month. Lakhs of illegal structures or unauthorised buildings, largely residential ones including those like the controversial Campa Cola compound in Worli, now stand to benefit from this policy. A senior urban development official said, ?We have formulated the rules mainly keeping residential structures in mind. Within six months of the rules coming into force, planning authorities will have to invite applications from owners and occupiers for consideration of cases for regularisation. The local authority will specify the time and date for the submission of such cases, after which applications will not be considered. The authority will then take a call on the cases as per the rules.?The official said even a case like the controversial Campa Cola compound in Worli stands to benefit if they have purchased the required Floor Space Index (FSI). FSI refers to the ratio of the built-up area to the plot area and indicates the permissible construction limit. The seven buildings in the Campa Cola compound have 35 floors more than what was approved by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), prompting the civic body to send a demolition notice leading to a long protracted legal battle.To pave the way for the regularisation of such structures, the state government passed a bill to amend the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act in the budget session of the legislature in April this year. The move will bring relief to lakhs of citizens in such buildings in places such as Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Navi Mumbai and Pimpri Chinchwad. However, it is also likely to set a precedent and open the decks for further condoning of illegal construction in the future.According to the draft rules, the state?s policy will apply to most cases of unauthorised construction, except for structures in ecologically sensitive zones, Coastal Regulation Zones, land meant for playgrounds or parks, heritage buildings and structurally unsafe buildings, among others.For cases of FSI violations, such as Campa Cola, the draft rules state such construction can be considered for regularisation by procuring premium or fungible FSI, or Transfer of Development Rights, as per applicable norms. Owners or occupants of such structures will have to pay compounding charges at 10 percent of land rate over and above the premium for the extra FSI.Similarly, the draft rules will also allow regularising construction where the structure is taller than the maximum height allowed as per the width of the road it abuts. While local authorities will have to explore the option of road widening in such cases, the state?s draft rules allow them to consider regularisation of the unauthorised construction by levying a compounding fee of 10 percent of the ready reckoner rates.The draft rules also provide for compounding fees for regularisation in case of inadequate setback area, violations in ground coverage, parking, staircase, passage width and misuse of any such free of FSI components. Moreover, building owner or occupants will need to procure the required no-objection certificates from departments such as drainage, water supply, fire, structural stability certificates and so on before regularisation.Once a civic body declares a structure as a compounded structure for regularisation, no further development will be allowed on the plot besides regular maintenance and repairs or redevelopment as per norms.The state government has instructed civic bodies to keep aside all the money collected as compounding fees under these rules for providing public amenities, utilities and services in the respective areas.Read more:Lakhs of illegal structures across Maharashtra to be regularised after penalties"
"An analysis by the Gurugram Police revealed that speeding, driving in the wrong lane, and pedestrians suddenly crossing the road are the three major causes of road accidents in Gurugram. Around 70 of the 199 accidents analysed were caused due to speeding. The data also revealed that 572 accidents with 213 casualties have happened so far this year.","Summarise: Speeding, driving in the wrong lane, and suddenly crossing the road, often by pedestrians, have emerged as three major reasons for road mishaps in Gurgaon, according to an analysis of around 200 accidents by the city police.A comparison of accident figures in the first half of 2016 and 2017 also revealed a slight dip in the number of accidents in 2017.In the first half of 2016, there had been 605 accidents and 218 deaths on Gurgaon?s roads.?For the corresponding period in 2017, there have been 572 accidents with 213 casualties. The number of people seriously injured in accidents during this period stood at 627 last year and is 585 this year.Gurgaon police commissioner, Sandeep Khirwar, said managing traffic and preventing accidents were two key challenges for his department.?New experiments and changes in traffic movement are being carried out to find a viable solution to these problems. Several drives against speeding, unauthorised parking and drink driving have helped in improving the situation,? he said.Of the 199 accidents analysed by the Gurgaon police, 70 were caused due to speeding.Driving on the wrong lane of the road, in opposite direction of traffic, is often seen on city roads, including the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, which is an access-controlled road. According to the data, 22 accidents were caused by driving in the wrong lane and 28 because someone suddenly rushed on to the road.Further, in the sample studied, being negligent or drowsy while driving was found to be the cause of 17 accidents. Fourteen were due to overtaking a vehicle from the left and 10 each due to the vehicle in front applying brakes suddenly and due to vehicles taking a sudden U-turn.Transport experts, however, termed these incidents as crashes and not accidents and held bad road engineering and poor planning responsible for these road mishaps, which they said were preventable.?Most of the roads in Gurgaon are designed for high-speed movement of vehicles at 70 to 80 km per hour. There is also a tendency among planners to not create U-turns while building roads, leading to people driving on the wrong side to reach their destination instead of driving an extra distance to take a turn,? said Amit Bhatt, a transport expert, adding that lack of enforcement of rules was also responsible.According to experts, planning and execution of roads has to be done as per the specific requirements of the city instead of building highways that they said are unnecessary."
"The Uttar Pradesh Government on Friday directed the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) to 'immediately' change land use of 3,000 acres of land in 17 villages in Jewar area of Noida, for the upcoming International Airport project. The land, which currently falls in agriculture zone will have to be marked as meant for 'airport', in YEIDA's Master Plan 2021. ","Summarise: The Uttar Pradesh civil aviation department has directed the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) to immediately change the land use of 3,000 hectares of agricultural land for Jewar airport project, officials said. The Uttar Pradesh government headed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath wants officials to fast track the airport project as it will help bring in investments to the state and facilitate the setting  up of industries, thereby generating employment. The Noida international airport project in Jewar will boost economic growth, officials said.Aiming to expedite the project, the UP government?s civil aviation department wants the YEIDA to begin the process of changing the land use ?immediately?.?I have ordered the planning department to prepare a proposal and begin the process to change the land-use of 3,000 hectares  of agricultural land in 17 villages. The UP government wants us to make necessary changes in our Master Plan 2021. The land that is shown for agricultural use now will be marked for the airport project in the master plan,? said Arun Vir Singh, YEIDA chief executive officer.The Union civil aviation ministry on June 24 gave a green signal for an international airport in Jewar, along the 165 km Yamuna Expressway. The YEIDA has also asked for a fund of Rs 2,000 crore and a dedicated team to begin land acquisition for the project. To begin with, the YEIDA will acquire 1,000 hectares of agricultural land. ?The crucial point is the change in land use. After preparing the proposal, we will publish a public notice in newspapers seeking objections from the public about changes in Master Plan 2021. The public will be able to give their suggestions and objections in 15 days,? said Singh. ?Subsequently we will approve the proposal in our board and then sent to UP government for approval. After UP approval we will send it to national capital region planning board for final approvals on land use change,? he said. The national capital region planning board (NCRPB), which was formed by the Centre in 1985, to contain haphazard urbanisation in Delhi and its neighbouring towns  of Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bulandshahr and Gurgaon, among others, will have to approve the proposal for changing agricultural land use. ?All states, including UP, Haryana and Rajasthan, are violating NCRPB provisions and acquiring agricultural land without following due procedure. This will, in the long run, create environmental issues,? said Raghuraj Singh, a Congress leader fighting a case on NCRPB violations in the Allahabad high court. However, the YEIDA officials said their plans have been approved by the planning board.?Our Master Plan 2021 is approved by the NCRPB. We will follow all procedures to change the land use for the airport project,? the CEO said."

The accused, Suraj Singh, was allegedly murdered by a co-accused in the gangrape following a scuffle. The two suspects fought after Singh reportedly blamed the entire incident on the co-accused. ","Summarise: An accused in the murder and gangrape of a 16-year-old girl in Himachal Pradesh?s Kotkhai died in police custody early Wednesday, triggering violent clashes across the state that saw a mob burn down a police station and pelt stones at security personnel.The accused, Nepalese national Surat Singh, was allegedly strangled by another suspect, Rajendra Singh, during a scuffle inside the lock-up around 3am on Wednesday, police said. News of his death sent ripples of anger through the Himalayan state as people shouted slogans, clashed with police and blocked arterial roads, demanding an overhaul of what protesters deem a shoddy probe.Shimla superintendent of police DW Negi said a fight broke out between Rajendra and Surat around midnight inside the lock up. ?Surat was rushed to hospital where he was declared brought dead,? said Negi.Violence in kothkai, shimla, after an accused in rape and murder of a minor died in police custody pic.twitter.com/BkDez8PHM1? Chetan Chauhan (@chetanecostani) July 19, 2017The gangrape of the minor girl has rocked the poll-bound state where such crimes are uncommon. The girl, a Class 10 student, went missing on her way home from school on July 4 and her naked body was found two days later with injury marks. Since then, her photos have gone viral on social media as hundreds of people have come out on the streets to protest in candlelight marches, silent processions and road blockades. The state government also bowed to increasing public pressure and transferred the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation.The entire staff of Kotkhai police station, including the station house inspector, were suspended following the custodial death. Sources said the SHO kept all the six accused in two cells instead of keeping them in separate enclosures.Surat Singh?s death sparked protests across the state as Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad members took out a rally in central Shimla. There were long traffic jams in the upper regions of Himachal Pradesh as people blocked the highway from Shimla to Kotkhai. The epicentre of the incident ? Kotkhai, around 60 kilometres from Shimla  ? resembled a war zone. In the afternoon, a violent mob of around 3,000 surrounded the police station, set it on fire and injured several personnel. The police fired in the air to disperse the crowd but failed as protesters surrounded the living quarters of personnel.Unrest over the case has been simmering since the police claimed a breakthrough on July 13, and arrested six people: Ashish Chauhan (29), Rajinder Singh (32) of Sharaal village, Subash Singh Bisht (42) of Pauri Garhwal, Surat Singh (29) of Nepal, Lok Jan (19) of Nepal and Deepak (38) of Garhwal. They were produced before a court in Theog and sent to seven-day police remand.The police alleged that Rajendra Singh offered her a lift to her village Shirguli, nearly five kilometers from the school. Rajendra was not alone and was accompanied by four-five friends who were drunk.

"US President Donald Trump used his speech to the 19th National Boy Scouts Jamboree in West Virginia to attack ""fake media"" for allegedly misquoting crowd size at his events. Trump also urged his audience of 12 to 18-year-olds to boo his presidential rival Hillary Clinton and predecessor Barack Obama. Trump was slammed for using the traditional address for political endorsements. ","Summarise: On Monday evening, Donald Trump gave a speech to the 19th National Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia. Although he came armed with a prepared speech about the merits of scouting ? each US president serves as the group?s honorary president ? and declared at the start that he would not talk about politics, Trump went predictably off-script to talk about some favourite topics. And politics.Boy, you have a lot of people. The press will say it?s about 200 people. It looks like about 45,000 people.Tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington DC that you have been hearing about with the fake news and all of that ? Who the hell wants to talk about politics when I?m in front of the Boy Scouts?Today I said we oughta change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool or perhaps to the word sewer, but it?s not good.The scouts believe in putting America first.The vice-president of the United States, Mike Pence ? good guy ? was a scout and it meant so much to him. Some of you here tonight might even have camped out in this yard when Mike was the governor of Indiana, but the scouting was very, very important. And by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight? I wonder if the television cameras will follow you; they don?t like doing that when they see these massive crowds. They don?t like doing that. Hi folks. A lot of love in this big, beautiful place. A lot of love and a lot of love for our country. There?s a lot of love for our country.By the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible, massive crowd, record-setting, is going to be shown on television tonight? One per cent or zero? The fake media will say: President Trump ? and you know what this is ? President Trump spoke before a small crowd of Boy Scouts today. That?s some ? that is some crowd. Fake media. Fake news. Thank you.Secretary Tom Price is also here ? And hopefully he?s going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this thing known as Obamacare that?s really hurting us, folks.By the way, are you going to get the votes? He better get them. He better get them. Oh, he better ? otherwise I?ll say, Tom, you?re fired. I?ll get somebody. He better get Senator Capito [Republican West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito] to vote for it. You got to get the other senators to vote for it. It?s time. After seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare, we have a chance to now do it. They better do it.By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a jamboree? And we?ll be back. We?ll be back. The answer is no, but we?ll be back.I have to tell you our economy is doing great. Our stock market has picked up since the election November 8. Do we remember that date? Was that a beautiful date? What a date. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8, where they said ? these dishonest people ? where they said there is no path to victory for Donald Trump? ? But do you remember that incredible night with the maps and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable and they didn?t know what to say? And you know we have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college ? popular vote is much easier.So I have to tell you, what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for Make America Great Again.And by the way, under the Trump administration, you?ll be saying Merry Christmas again when you go shopping. Believe me. Merry Christmas. They?ve been downplaying that little beautiful phrase. You?re going to be saying Merry Christmas again, folks.I?ll tell you a story that?s very interesting for me when I was young. There was a man named William Levitt, Levitttowns, you have some here, you have some in different states ? And he was a very successful man. He was a homebuilder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful ?And he sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. At the time especially, this was a long time ago, sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. And he went out and bought a big yacht and he had a very interesting life. I won?t go any more than that because you?re Boy Scouts, I?m not going to tell you what he did ? should I tell you? Should I tell you? Oh, you?re Boy Scouts, but you know life, you know life. So, look at you, who would think this is the Boy Scouts, right?So he had a very interesting life, and the company that bought his company was a big conglomerate. And they didn?t know anything about building homes, and they didn?t know anything about picking up the nails and the sawdust and selling it, and the scraps of wood ? So they called William Levitt up and they said, would you like to buy back your company and he said yes, I would. He so badly wanted it, he got bored with this life of yachts and sailing and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places ? But what happened is he bought back his company and he bought back a lot of empty land ? and in the end he failed and he failed badly. Lost all of his money. He went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older.And I saw him at a cocktail party and it was very sad. Because the hottest people in New York were at this party. It was the party of Steve Ross. Steve Ross, he was one of the great people. He came up and discovered ? really founded ? Time Warner, and he was a great guy. He had a lot of successful people at the party. And I was doing well so I got invited to the party.[This is a much abbreviated version: you can read the full Levitt reminiscence here and here.]"

"US-based scientists have devised a computer method called 'ZeitZeiger' that uses blood samples to accurately predict circadian time, the time of day according to a person's body clock. ZeitZeiger used 15 genes from across human genome to predict body's internal time which, the scientists say, could be used to help diagnose and monitor sleep-related disorders and also to personalise treatments.","Summarise: Washington, Feb 28 (PTI) Scientists have developed a novel computer method called ZeitZeiger that uses a sample of blood to accurately predict circadian time - the time of day according to a persons body clock. ""Our study demonstrates a method for predicting a persons internal time of day that could eventually be used to help diagnose and monitor circadian- and sleep-related disorders, and also to personalise treatments,"" said Jake Hughey from Vanderbilt University in the US. ""This is the first study to use genome-wide expression data from many individuals to develop a biomarker of the circadian clock in human blood,"" Hughey said. ""Previous efforts to monitor the circadian clock in human tissues were based on a small number of individuals and/or a small set of pre-selected genes. Our method, ZeitZeiger, uses 15 genes from across the human genome to predict circadian time,"" he said. The researchers were surprised to find that 13 out of these 15 genes were not core genes of the human circadian clock. Core genes are necessary for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. They can be compared to the gears of a mechanical watch. ""Most of the genes that were selected for ZeitZeiger seem to be outputs of the clock; that is they are not the gears controlling the clock, but the hands telling the time. ""This shows that when given data for almost every gene in the genome, the algorithm can figure out which set of genes gives the best predictions, even if they are not core clock genes,"" Hughey said. In addition to predicting circadian time, the researchers demonstrated that ZeitZeiger can also be used to show how disruptions to sleep-wake and light-dark cycles affect the circadian clock. The rhythms produced by the circadian clock differ widely between individuals at any given time of day and they are often disrupted by modern environments, for example due to shift work or reduced exposure to sunlight. Circadian dysfunction is linked to conditions such as cancer, depressive disorder and obesity. Knowledge of an individuals circadian rhythms could be used to optimise the timing of therapeutic interventions, which is known as chronotherapy. "

Two Peruvian brothers were reportedly set on fire by fishermen in Chile in an attack that was reportedly triggered by competition between seaweed collectors. The attack comes amid an increase in racial discrimination in Chile against immigrants who arrive mainly from other Latin American and Caribbean countries. The victims suffered second and third-degree burns over half their bodies.,"Summarise: Two Peruvian brothers are recovering in hospital in the Chilean city of Antofagasta after being doused with petrol and set alight by a mob of Chilean fishermen in the port city of Tocopilla. Juan JimÃ©nez Ninaja and JosÃ© DÃ­az Ninaja were left with second- and third-degree burns to over half their bodies after the attack. The two brothers had collected seaweed in the region for five years, helping to supply a multimillion-dollar aquaculture export industry. Mainly shipped to Japan, China and France, the plants are used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as well as being eaten. The incident took place amid an increasingly heated debate over the recent surge in migration to Chile, mainly from other Latin American and Caribbean countries, and growing racial tensions in the Antofagasta region. According to Elizabeth Andrade, a Peruvian social worker and one of the leaders of a migrant squatter camp in the city of Antofagasta, the attack was triggered by competition between seaweed collectors. The brothers had received threats over the last few months and were in the process of clearing out their hut to leave Tocopilla when they were set upon, Andrade said. In recent years, 64 camps have sprung up around the city of Antofagasta. The camps? occupants receive some support from local authorities in terms of security and access to healthcare and education, while pro-migrant Chilean NGOs have also been working with the migrants to improve living conditions. Andrade said the local press bore some responsibility for fanning resentment against immigrants, by exaggerating the number of foreigners involved in criminal activities and calling for the expulsion of all immigrants. ?It?s really difficult for migrants to adapt to Chilean society, as well as for Chileans to live alongside so many foreigners ? they?re not used to it. But in the last couple of years there?s been a real surge in racial discrimination,? she said.Migrants? rights activists say that the incident underlines the urgent need for new legislation to replace outdated immigration law imposed by the Pinochet dictatorship in 1975, along with well-planned policies to deal with the recent surge in migration to Chile."

"Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport has become a transit point for drug trade with over 19 arrests at the airport so far this year, officials said. This was reportedly double the corresponding number last year. Narcotics Control Bureau's records show that 15 people were arrested for smuggling drugs this year in July, as compared to only two in July 2016.","Summarise: Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport - the busiest in the country - is not only the top choice for travellers but also for drug smugglers. According to officials, Delhi airport has become the transit point of drug trade as more than 19 people have been arrested from here till date, which is almost double from last year's corresponding period.Officials claim it is an indicator that the drug market is flourishing in the city and that there are good incentives given by the drug mafia which pulls so many into this risky business.Narcotics Control Bureau's (NCB) records show that 15 people were arrested in eight cases for smuggling 18.05kg of cocaine till July this year while in 2016, only two cases were registered and 215 grams of the drug was seized. Similarly, NCB officials seized 14.44kg of methaqualone and arrested three people till July while in previous year, a total of 17 kg of narcotic substance was recovered and three were arrested.Despite constant vigil and action against drug traffickers by multiple agencies such as Customs, NCD, DRI, Immigration, CISF and the Delhi Police, the number of seizures in the city have only grown. In most of these cases, foreign nationals were involved but a recent case has left security agencies puzzled as Customs officials seized nearly 2kg of a morphine mixture from a food trolley while it was being wheeled out of an Air India flight. Officials suspect an inside job behind it but the incident exposed deeprooted nexus of drug smugglers with airport staff and officials. No arrest has been made yet. However, investigators are trying to find how the drug reached inside the plane despite having several security checks.DELHI IS THE BIGGEST CONSUMER OF DRUGS""Delhi itself is one of the biggest consumers of drugs. Its proximity with NCR towns such as Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad, where rave parties are common, also attract drug peddlers,"" said a senior security official at IGI on the condition of anonymity. He added the inflow of the drug is huge because there is a big market in the city that targets youth and students. Security agencies claim that smugglers are using innovative modus operandi and new travel routes to smuggle drugs inside the country.""Heroin is mainly smuggled into India from Pakistan. Once it reaches Delhi, it is supplied to local dealers who channel it to rave parties and individuals. Besides, the popular party drug is also shipped to European and American countries concealed in small parcels via air,"" a senior NCB official said.""Drug couriers are largely intercepted and detected at international airports. Delhi is the most connected airport from foreign countries and as it is connected with several bordering states, it further makes it easy for local peddlers to transport drugs in other parts of the country,"" a senior narcotics official said.Drugs are mainly concealed in false cavities of books, paintings, machinery parts and toys, among others. There are also professional 'swallowers' or mules who are hired and paid handsomely for cocaine trafficking by swallowing small capsules or packets of drugs or hiding them inside their private parts, the officer said. As the criminals are getting smarter, agencies are adopting various steps, including strict surveillance, enforcement at export or import points of the airport and training of drug law enforcement agencies to keep a check on new modus operandi."

It has amended the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, in order to speed up investigation in such cases. Earlier, there was no such time frame to complete such enquiries.","Summarise: New Delhi, Jun 5 (PTI) Changing an over 50-year-old rule, the government has set a deadline of six months to complete probe in corruption cases involving its employees. The decision has been taken to speed up the investigation in such cases, most of them pending for quiet a long time. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has amended Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, and decided time-line for critical stages of investigation and enquiry proceedings. The Inquiring Authority should conclude the inquiry and submit its report within a period of six months, says the amended rules. However, an extension for a period not exceeding six months at a time may be allowed for any good and sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing by the disciplinary authority, it said. Earlier, there was no time-frame to complete an enquiry. The disciplinary authority shall deliver to a government servant, accused of irregularity and corruption, a copy of the articles of charge, the statement of the imputations of misconduct or misbehaviour and a list of documents and witnesses by which each article or charges is proposed to be sustained, the new rules said. On receipt of such articles of charge, the government servant shall be required to submit his written statement of defence, if he so desires, and also state whether he desires to be heard in person, within a period of 15 days, it said. The time-limit can, however, be extended for a period not exceeding fifteen days. But under no circumstances, the extension of time for filing written statement of defence shall exceed forty-five days from the date of receipt of articles of charge, the rules said. At present, there is no time-limit for submission of the employees statement of defence. The new rules are applicable to all category of employees excluding those in all-India services--Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS)-- and a few other categories of officers. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), in a directive, had last year expressed serious concern over delay in finalising corruption cases and asked all departments to complete these inquiries within a maximum period of six months to keep away ""nothing will change"" notion associated with governance.

"Indian para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande, who is completely blind, won a silver at the Para Swimming Championships in Germany after borrowing money to participate. Kanchanmala, who took a loan of ?5 lakh after money sanctioned by the government did not reach her, also qualified for the World Championships with the win. She paid the accommodation and visa expenses on her own.","Summarise: As a para-athlete, Kanchanmala Pande knows well how to swim against the tide. But this time, she was left high and dry by India's sports authorities.Nagpur-based Kanchanmala, who is completely sightless and swims in the S11 category, had to face extreme misery during her trip to Berlin because of alleged slip-ups by the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI).She and five others participating in the Para Swimming Championships in the German capital from July 3-9 had a harrowing time as the government money sanctioned for their tour did not reach them.In the end, Kanchanmala had to beg and borrow money in an unfamiliar city. The PCI, however, has blamed the Sports Authority of India for the lapse.But the situation failed to deter the athletes' fierce determination. Despite all odds, Kanchanmala and Suyash Jadhav won silver medals and qualified for the World Championships.Kanchanmala, 26, beat the qualifying mark in 100m Freestyle (1:34:00), 100m Backstroke (1:41:00), 100m Breaststroke (2:01:00) and 200m Individual Medley (3:03:00), in which she also picked up a silver medal. She became the only female swimmer from India to qualify for the World Para Swimming Championships this year.The sportspersons have been inspired by India's remarkable show at the Rio Paralympics last year, where the country posted its best-ever performance by winning two golds, a silver and a bronze.'NEVER THOUGHT WOULD FACE SUCH PROBLEMS'Kanchanmala and her escort Jaimala Pande were part of the Berlin contingent that was granted sponsorship by the government. However, the PCI failed to provide her the money and she was forced to bear her hotel and food expenses.""I never thought I would face such problems. I had to take a loan of Rs 5 lakh so that I could participate in the tournament. I had to qualify for the World Championships and I don't know why PCI didn't understand its importance,"" Kanchamala, who is also an assistant with the Reserve Bank of India in Nagpur, told Mail Today.""I was not given any official confirmation if I will receive a reimbursement for the expense I bore. I had to pay around Rs 70,000 for the hotel and more than Rs 40,000 for food. There was a time when I had no money left. I was simply devastated. Moreover, they put my name in 50m Backstroke when it was never my event. I had to write letters to the International Paralympic Committee when a coach was appointed to take care of the swimmers.""The swimmers were also asked to arrange their visas, which cost her additional Rs 15,000. To add to the misery, Kanchanmala, who won a bronze at the 2011 World Para Games, was shocked to see that the PCI had registered her in the 50m Backstroke event when she had actually applied for the 100m Backstroke.'HORROR SHOW'In her own words, Kanchanmala's Europe trip was no less than a ""horror show"". The coach Kanchanmala refers to is Kanwaljeet Singh, the man sent by the PCI to assist the para-swimmers.Singh was allegedly of almost no help, often going missing during the main events while also going to the extent of asking for 90 pounds (Rs 7,462) as participation fee.""He (Singh) didn't help me at all. I used to go back to the hotel just with my escort and god knows where he used to be. Once, I took a tram from the tournament venue to my hotel and I had no money. I had to travel without ticket and was caught by the checker who later fined me 120 pounds (about Rs 10,000),"" Kanchanmala said.""He (Singh) asked for participation fee from me when it should be PCI paying for all of this. Even though he paid the fee later, I had a very rough time with him. A coach should be helpful and always take care of athletes. I didn't see any of that.""BLAME GAMEHowever, PCI vice-president Gurucharan Singh maintained that the Sports Authority of India (SAI) had not sanctioned the amount for the tournament while also saying that the swimmers will be refunded their money.""We are facing problems from with SAI regarding sanction of amount for championships. The money for swimming championship in Berlin didn't come on time and as the process takes around 3-4 days, we weren't able to provide it to the swimmers,"" he said.""I am here in London for the World Athletics Championship and we are also facing a problem of shortage of money. SAI sanctioned just 40,000 pounds (Rs 33.16 lakh) while the organisers are asking for 80,000 pounds (Rs 66.32 lakh). We will hold meetings with SAI officials to discuss this matter. So, a fix to all this will be done once the London meet is over. I assure you, the swimmers will be given back their money. As for the coach problem, I am not aware of it. As soon as I get back to India, we will talk to the swimmers and will carry out an inquiry if needed.""Despite the frustrations, Kanchanmala fulfilled her dream to qualify for her second World Championship and wants to put all this behind as she aims for more glory in the September meet."

Adding that the situation could get ""worse"", China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said that India will face ""embarrassment"" if it does not withdraw its border troops to its own side.","Summarise: With no end in sight to the standoff in the Sikkim sector, China on Saturday said there is ?no room? for negotiations to resolve the military face-off and the only solution is the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Donglang or Doklam region.India will face ?embarrassment? if it does not withdraw its border troops to its own side and the situation could get ?worse?,Â  the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Saturday night.?China has made it clear that there is no room for negotiations on this incident, and India must withdraw its border-crossing troops from Doklam. For China, border line is the bottom line,? the commentary said.The commentary sought to add yet another dimension to the face-off by bringing in the Ladakh region and linking it to Pakistan, China?s ?iron brother? ally. ?India should not regard the existing situation as the same as or even similar to the previous two standoffs in 2013 and 2014 near Ladakh, a disputed area between China, Pakistan and India in southeastern Kashmir. Diplomatic efforts led the troop?s frictions there to a well-arranged end. But this time it is a totally different case,? it added.It is rare for China to call Ladakh a ?disputed? region and make a reference to Kashmir.This is the first time that China has clearly articulated ? through one of its primary official channels - that there is no room for parleys to resolve the weeks-long impasse in Donglang, which is under China?s control but claimed by Bhutan.Until now, the foreign ministry had listed the withdrawal of Indian troops hinted as a precondition for resolving the face-off but had hinted there is an ongoing effort to end it through diplomatic negotiations.Xinhua is an organ of the Chinese government and is affiliated to the State Council, the Communist country?s cabinet.Commentaries published by Xinhua and the People?s Daily, the Communist Party of China (CPC) mouthpiece, are taken to be a reflection of the thoughts of the government and the all-powerful CPC.?India has repeatedly ignored China's call for pulling its border-crossing troops from Doklam area back to its own territory. However, turning a deaf ear to China will but worsen the month-long standoff and put itself further into embarrassment,? the commentary said.It added that India had ?lied? to the world by saying it dispatched troops to Donglang to help its ally Bhutan, whereas ?apparently? Thimphu had extended no invitation to New Delhi to intervene.?New Delhi claimed encroachment of its own territory by China before saying it sent troops to ?protect? its ?ally? Bhutan, a sovereign state which has apparently so far made no such an invitation for the sake of that boundary area,? it said.Bhutan and China don?t have diplomatic ties but have held 24 rounds of talks to resolve a boundary dispute.The commentary, however, described foreign secretary S Jaishankar?s remarks during a recent speech in Singapore as a ?positive? sign.?As an old Chinese saying goes, peace is most precious. It has been noticed that Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar recently has made positive remarks in Singapore, saying that ?India and China should not let differences become disputes?,? it said.?What China would like to see more are corresponding actions taken by India.?China has a will to solve the problem peacefully by diplomatic means, and China also cherishes the peace and serenity in the border areas, but the precondition is that the trespassers of India must withdraw unconditionally.?Â "

"The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Tuesday said that Shiv Sena was never a Hindutvavadi outfit and was pretending to be one only for political gains. Bal Thackeray himself was clueless about his party workers bringing portions of the mosque down in Ayodhya, said VHP. ""You don't become Hindutvavadi by merely chanting Chhatrapati Shivaji's name,"" it added. ","Summarise: gains: VHP New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) today said NDA constituent Shiv Sena was never a Hindutvavadi outfit and was pretending to be one only for political gains. Speaking to reporters here, VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain said that merely chanting King Shivajis name does not make Shiv Sena a Hindutvavadi (one championing the Hindutva cause) party. ""I dont think Shiv Sena was ever a Hindutvavadi organisation. It is the media which gave this tag to Shiv Sena after Babri mosque was demolished,"" Jain said. ""It is pretending to be a Hindutuvavadi organisation for political gains,"" he added. His remark comes against the backdrop of stinging verbal exchanges between long-standing allies Shiv Sena and BJP leaders ahead of Maharashtra civic polls, voting for which was held today. Seeking to buttress his claim, the VHP leader stated late Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray himself was ""clueless"" about his party workers bringing portions of the mosque down in Uttar Pradeshs Ayodhya in 1992. ""He (Thackeray) himself had said he had no clue about it. But he said he was a proud man if his party men demolished the mosque. That one statement made them Hindutva champion...you dont become Hindutvavadi by merely chanting Chhatrapati Shivajis name,"" Jain claimed. Apparently referring to Shiv Senas sons-of-the-soil campaign in Maharashtra, particularly Mumbai, Jain said the party is rather a ""fissiparous"" force, which targeted its own Hindu brothers from south and north India for ""narrow benefits"" and does not understand broad concepts of Hindutva. ""When they talk about Hindutva...are Hindus from Tamil Nadu not Hindus? Whether Hindus from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are not Hindus? Even today, they are beaten there (in Mumbai). "

Some Internet companies say it is impossible to block all such sites because many of the servers that host them are outside India. Also, the sites can still be accessed through proxy servers.However, researchers from Australia's University of Melbourne found in a study last month that young people who watch pornography, which is now easily accessible on smartphones and other devices, are more likely to sexually abuse another child or young person.Referring to ""increasing"" instances where auto drivers, bus drivers and conductors indulge in molestation and sodomy, the affidavit says, ""Limited access to persons making request to visit porn sites, may be provided (like VPN gateway server, etc) with certain conditions like: Instead of making payment to the Service providers, a hefty amount be made to the Government of India. This way, it is reflected in the bank accounts; also people like auto-drivers and people belonging to such similar strata of the society will have restricted access to online pornography. Also, it can be a great revenuegenerating model for the government.""HAVE COUNSELLORS FOR KIDS"

"US President Donald Trump has said he signed the anti-Russia sanctions bill, which accuses Russia of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and punishes the country for its annexation of Crimea, ""for the sake of national unity"". Calling the bill ""seriously flawed"", Trump said that it encroaches on his authority to negotiate to strike good deals for the US.","Summarise: President Donald Trump on Wednesday called the Russia sanctions legislation he signed into law ?seriously flawed? and urged Congress to not use the measure to hinder US efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict with its European allies.The legislation is aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the 2016 US presidential election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad. The law also imposes financial sanctions against Iran and North Korea.Trump said the law will ?punish and deter bad behavior by the rogue regimes in Tehran and Pyongyang? and enhance existing sanctions on Moscow.The president had been reluctant to proceed with the bill, even after it was revised to include some changes that American and European companies sought to ensure that business deals were not stifled by new sanctions. Trump has expressed frustration over Congress? ability to limit or override the power of the White House on national security matters, saying that it is complicating efforts to coordinate with allies ? a sentiment he expressed in Wednesday?s statement.Last week, the House overwhelmingly backed the bill, 419-3, and the Senate rapidly followed its lead on a 98-2 vote. Those margins guaranteed that Congress would be able to beat back any attempt by Trump to veto the measure.The president said Wednesday that he signed the bill ?for the sake of national unity.??The bill remains seriously flawed ? particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch?s authority to negotiate,? Trump said. ?By limiting the executive?s flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.?MORE: Full statement - @W7VOA pic.twitter.com/haHU4cAg7i? Conflict News (@Conflicts) August 2, 2017Trump?s talk of extending a hand of cooperation to Russian President Vladimir Putin has been met with resistance as skeptical lawmakers look to limit his leeway. The new measure targets Russia?s energy sector as part of legislation that prevents Trump from easing sanctions on Moscow without congressional approval.Those limits, backed by Republicans as well as Democrats, resulted from lawmakers? worries that Trump might ease the financial hits without first securing concessions from Putin. Republicans refused to budge even after the White House complained that the ?congressional review? infringed on Trump?s executive authority.Moscow responded to a White House announcement last week that Trump intended to sign the bill, ordering a reduction in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia.Top members of Trump?s administration voiced their unhappiness with the bill anew this week, echoing his sentiments that it poses more diplomatic hindrances than solutions.?Neither the president nor I are very happy about that,? Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday of the sanctions bill, which he had urged lawmakers not to approve.?We were clear that we didn?t think that was going to be helpful to our efforts, but that?s the decision they made,? he said.Tillerson conceded that he is unable to show that the US has fulfilled Trump?s objective of a new, more cooperative relationship between the former Cold War foes, noting only modest efforts in Syria as a sign the nations share some common goals. While he said Americans want the US to get along with the nuclear-armed power, he did not address other concerns at home. US intelligence agencies have accused Moscow of meddling in the 2016 presidential election to help Trump.?The situation is bad, but believe me ? it can get worse,? Tillerson said.Vice President Mike Pence, traveling Tuesday in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, sought to reframe the sanctions as a ?further sign of our commitment? to counter Russian aggression in the region.?The president and our Congress are unified in our message to Russia: A better relationship, the lifting of sanctions will require Russia to reverse the actions that caused the sanctions to be imposed in the first place,? Pence said. ?And not before.?Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle celebrated the passage of the sanctions bill.?It?s long overdue,? Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said of Trump?s decision to sign the bill nearly a week after it cleared Congress. ?Hope we?ll send again a strong message to Russia that we can?t have interference in our elections going forward.?Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he hadn?t read the statement Trump issued announcing that he?d signed the sanctions bill. But Corker, who shepherded the legislation through the Senate, appeared indifferent to Trump?s criticisms. ?Somebody pointed it out,? Corker said exiting the Senate chamber after a vote. ?That?s fine.?"

BJP Delhi President Manoj Tiwari on Friday urged Delhi's traders to stop selling Chinese goods to give a big blow to the Chinese economy.

Tiwari was interacting with traders of Khan Market and Hauz Khas Village on Friday evening, regarding their concerns on the roll out of GST.Traders' association of Khan Market said it would ask traders not to sell Chinese goods during the upcoming festive season.

After all it is in the national interest,"" said Sanjiv Mehra, President of Khan Market Traders' Association.CHINA FRUSTRATED: TIWARIReferring to China in the context of GST, Tiwari said it was troubled by the economic reform in India and the tension on border was an outcome of China's frustration.""China is acting like a goonda. It is disturbed by India's growing economic and strategic power. Since India is the biggest market of Chinese goods, we must stop using them. This will affect China's economy the most,"" Tiwari said.Last year, too, there came up a campaign to boycott Chinese goods in the wake of ""Make in India"", which escalated after the Uri attack, ahead of Diwali. However, Tiwari noted that last year traders had already stocked large quantities of Chinese products such as firecrackers and lights, and hence feared heavy losses.""This year you (traders) should rethink purchasing Chinese products ahead of the festive season,"" he appealed.Another trader of Khan Market said that he supported the call for boycotting Chinese goods, but sought from the government a hassle-free trading environment within the country so that their business was not affected. He also suggested that awareness should be created among the public about the benefits of GST.About the concerns over GST, Tiwari assured the traders that government would not harass citizens. He said the grievances will be addressed soon.Also Read:Why China will mend ways to defuse border tension and not boast of 1962"
"The most resilient form of life on Earth, tardigrade, also known as water bear, will survive until the Sun dies, as per an Oxford University research. The eight-legged micro-animal can survive for 30 years without food or water, and endure temperature extremes from -270ÂºC to 150ÂºC. Further, tardigrades can withstand catastrophic events like large asteroid impacts, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts.","Summarise: Whether it is a supernova or an asteroid impact, should a cosmic calamity strike, it seems there will be at least one form of life left: a tubby, microscopic animal with the appearance of a crumpled hoover bag.The creatures, known as tardigrades, are staggeringly hardy animals, a millimetre or less in size, with species living in wet conditions that range from mountain tops to chilly ocean waters to moss and lichen on land.?They can survive incredible conditions ? we are talking close to absolute zero, the vacuum of space, exposure to radiation that would kill us, and these things just walk away from it like nothing happened,? said David Sloan, an astrophysicist from the University of Oxford.Now new research by Sloan and colleagues has shown that the creatures would survive any cosmic disaster that might conceivably be thrown at Earth ? a discovery that could have implications elsewhere in the solar system, and beyond. ?There are quite a lot of stars like our sun out there, and about 20% of these stars have an Earth-like planet around them,? said Sloan. ?What you then want to ask is if life started on one of these planets, what are the odds that it is still around??Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers describe how they probed the conundrum by exploring the likelihood of a variety of catastrophes serious enough to wipe out tardigrades on an Earth-like planet, including a nearby supernova, a burst of gamma-rays, and an impact by a large asteroid powerful enough to cause the oceans to boil away. But the team found that the chances of such events were so remote as to be extremely unlikely ? there was little chance of a supernova occurring close enough to an Earth-like planet to kill off the creatures, and it would take an impact from an asteroid or dwarf planet near the mass of Vesta for the oceans to boil. ?There are about 17 [asteroids] this big in our solar system, but they are all on sufficient orbits that they will never intersect with us,? said Sloan. The upshot, he said, was that it was very unlikely any cosmic event would be so catastrophic as to sterilise an Earth-like planet where life, of the sort we know, had got going. ?Because [tardigrades] are so hardy it means that events that we are worried about as human beings, and rightly so, certainly wouldn?t concern you if you just considered all life,? said Sloan. Matthew Cobb, professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, who was not involved in the study said the findings were reassuring for the future of life on Earth.?It suggests that the complete eradication of life on Earth is extremely unlikely until we get to the point that the sun enlarges and all the oceans boil away,? he said. ?Many organisms, in particular animals and bacteria, live in the deep ocean, which the authors show would be unaffected by any conceivable cosmic cataclysm.?Mark Blaxter, professor of evolutionary genomics at the University of Edinburgh, agreed, adding that there are other organisms have a similar survival strategy to tardigrades. What?s more, he said, there are also organisms that live very deep underground in hot water within continental and under-sea-floor rocks. ?Sterilising the planet would have to deal with these too,? he noted. He also stressed that even tardigrades are not invincible. ?[Land-based] tardigrades stay alive in extreme conditions by drying out completely. So if there was no water left ? there would be no ?live? tardigrades, just dried up ones,? said Blaxter. ?And if there was some water left so that the tardigrades could re-animate, if there was no food left they eat algae and fungi - they too would be dead in a couple of weeks.?Cobb, too, noted that even if the tardigrades were the only survivors, they would face a struggle. ?For the tardigrades to inherit the Earth, whatever catastrophe swept over the planet would have to return to normal-ish conditions within a matter of decades at most, or it really could be curtains,? he said."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that police will conduct a preliminary enquiry before making any arrest in dowry harassment cases to ensure there is no misuse of law. A Family Welfare Committee will be set up in every district to scrutinise the cases, only after which will the arrests be made effective, the court said.","Summarise: A Family Welfare Committee (FWC) in every district will scrutinise dowry harassment cases before local police can arrest the accused, the Supreme Court said on Thursday, laying down a set of guidelines to curb misuse of the law.Indian Penal Code?s Section 498A has been criticised for giving ?disgruntled women? a legal option to harass their husbands, and Thursday?s orders take forward measures announced by the top court in 2014 when it prohibited automatic arrests.A bench of justices AK Goel and UU Lalit barred the police from making direct arrest and said the involvement of civil society was necessary ?to achieve the laudable object of punishing cruelty at the hands of husbands or his relatives against the wife?.Quoting the National Crime Records Bureau?s 2012 data, the bench said that a quarter of all arrests were those of women ? mothers and sisters of husbands ? and while chargesheets were filed at an ?exponentially high 93.6%? of cases, only 14.4% ended in convictions. The report projected that out of the 3,72,706 cases pending trial in 2012, as many as 3,17,000 were projected to lead to acquittals.Curbing misuseForm 3-member committee in every district of para-legal volunteers, social workers, working officers? wives or suitable citizensDecide bail applications on same day as far as possibleGrant exemption from personal appearance or allow it by videoconferencingDon?t make passport impounding or red corner notice routine for people residing out of IndiaThe court, however, put a rider to its restrictions, saying that they were not valid in offences involving tangible physical injury or death.?It is a matter of serious concern that large number of cases continues to be filed under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women. To remedy the situation, we are of the view that involvement of civil society in the aid of administration of justice can be one of the steps, apart from the investigating officers and the concerned trial courts being sensitised,? the bench said.The top court also ordered that trial courts must decide bail applications in such cases on the same day as far as possible. Recovery of disputed dowry items may not by itself be a ground for denial of bail if maintenance or other rights of wife/minor children can otherwise be protected, SC said.According to the ruling, the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) will form the committee comprising three members who could be para-legal volunteers, social workers, retired persons, wives of working officers or citizens who may be found suitable and willing.A dowry harassment complaint to the police or magistrate will be referred to the committee that can interact with the parties personally or through electronic communication. The committee must submit its report to the authority, which refers the complaint to it within a month.Till the report is received, no arrest should be effected, the court said. After considering the report on its own merit, the police or magistrate will proceed with further action.SC also directed that only a designated Investigating Officer of the area shall investigate dowry harassment cases. Such designations must be done within a month, the court said. These officers must be trained, which the court held must be completed within four months.In further directions to lower courts, the SC said that accused should be exempted from appearing in person or be allowed to appear via video conferencing as far as that does not adversely affect the progress of the case.In cases where accused is residing out of India, impounding of passports or red corner notice should not be a routine, the court said.In cases where a settlement is reached, it will be open to a district and sessions judge or any other senior judicial officer nominated by him in the district to complete the proceedings including the closing of the criminal case if dispute primarily relates to matrimonial discord. Committee?s functioning may be reviewed once a year, SC added.In 2014, a separate bench had criticised the law?s misuse and said: ?The fact that Section 498-A is a cognisable and non-bailable offence has lent it a dubious place of pride amongst the provisions that are used as weapons rather than shield by disgruntled wives?."

Novak Djokovic speaks. ?It?s not the shoulder, it?s the elbow that keeps bothering me. For over a year and a half actually. It?s unfortunate I have to finish Wimbledon in this way. I was able for 30 minutes to play with some pain that was bearable. All the treatments and medication couldn?t help.

Whereas, Rajesh, who works at a glass manufacturing unit in Mumbai, alleged that the flight attendant did not extend immediate medical help and she could not put on the mask during the journey. He also claimed that she felt unwell an hour after the plane took off from Mumbai and soon collapsed. He has filed a complaint alleging negligence on the part of flight, saying the attendants did not extend necessary medical help at the time of emergency.

The video continued for several minutes and was stopped only after some commuters brought it to the attention of DMRC officials at the station.The incident was recorded by several commuters on their mobile phones and has been shared multiple times on various social media platforms, forcing the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to initiate an inquiry. DMRC said three unidentified men may have played the clip on the big screen as the system is not secure.Anuj Dayal, the DMRC spokesperson, said after preliminary investigations, it has been established that the incident took place around 5pm on April 9. ?The LED TV system was being commissioned and its Wi-Fi port was accessible. Prima facie, as per CCTV footage, three men played the porn clip through their mobile (phone) on this TV at Rajiv Chowk station. Attempts are being made to identify these men. CCTV footage is under examination to identify the culprits,? said Dayal.?This sort of interference with the system will not be possible in the future once the software is programmed and centrally controlled. In the interim, during the commissioning process, the contractor will be advised to ensure password protection,? Dayal added.A video of the area, recorded by a commuter, showed most people walk past the screen either clueless or unbothered. A few others, however, stopped by to record the unusual activity on their mobile phones. A few of them then alerted the DMRC officials who rushed into action to turn off the broadcast.Delhi Police, meanwhile, said they have not received any complaint from the DMRC in this connection. ?If the DMRC approaches us after completing their internal probe, we will go ahead with the legal proceedings,? said a senior police officer.?The objective of the LED screens is to disseminate information to passengers through various multimedia tools,? said another DMRC spokesperson.A similar incident had been reported from Wayanad district in Kerala in 2015.

So let?s not target only the film industry.Nandita Das: I am sure it is no surprise to anyone that Nawazuddin?s skin colour would have impeded his career. All around us the images of women and now increasingly of men, are those with light skin. Be it films, television, magazines, hoardings, ads... Everywhere we have ?fair? people, in a country that is largely dark! Every skin care product has a skin lightening element. Dark skinned people are often  made to feel inadequate... right from their childhood. I can see the challenges that Nawazuddin must have faced in his career. After he has been around for over 10 years, it is his sheer talent and perseverance that has made him overcome this prejudice.Anshuman Jha: ?I am offered unconventional roles. But I personally haven?t faced any racism in this industry. But this industry is all about how good you look, and therefore discrimination is bound to exist. In the West, the black American actor Jamie Foxx can be paired opposite any leading lady. Here the criterion for casting is how compatible he or she looks with the other actor instead of performing abilities.Tannishtha Chatterjee: ?I think the film industry is not so colour biased. Such colour biases exist more in the advertising industry. Our society at large still suffers from these prejudices. Artistes and art need to speak up against societal prejudice. I?ve never endorsed fairness creams. I?ve never allowed anyone to make me look fair on screen. Pankaj Tripathi: Racism is part of the Indian mindset. We can?t escape it. However the very fact that Nawazuddin?s comment on racism has triggered off a reaction proves that the mindset is changing.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

"A 64-year-old woman is believed to have become the oldest mother in China to give birth. The 64-year-old, who delivered a boy weighing 3.7 kilograms through cesarean section, had conceived after receiving in vitro fertilisation (IVF) abroad. She and her husband decided to have a baby after they lost their first child, according to reports. ","Summarise: From K J M Varma Â  Beijing, Dec 30 (PTI) A 64-year-old woman in China is believed to have become the oldest mother in the country to give birth to a baby. The mother, who has not been identified, delivered a boy weighing 3.7 kgs through cesarean section at a hospital in Jilin province, official media here reported. She conceived the baby after receiving in vitro fertilisation abroad. Photos uploaded to social media yesterday showed the woman in a delivery room and a nurse holding a newborn. The woman and her husband declined to be interviewed, but people close to the family said the couple decided to have the baby after losing their first child, state-run China Daily reported. Teng Hong, a doctor who helped with the delivery, said the mother went through menopause about a decade ago. She was able to conceive after undergoing in vitro fertilisation overseas. Due to her age, the woman faced a lot of health risks during pregnancy, including gestational diabetes and internal bleeding, Teng said. ""But shes very strong. She received treatment with an optimistic attitude and overcame all the difficulties to gave birth,"" Teng said. She said the baby is in good condition. As the woman is no longer able to lactate, the child is being fed baby formula. ""Were keeping a close eye on the mother because women of this age can encounter cardiac failure and uncontrollable bleeding during or after a C-section, which are very dangerous,"" Teng said. In recent years, China has seen several cases of older women having children. Although there is no official data, including who is the oldest, anecdotal evidence suggests most of the older women had another baby after they lost their first child. Teng said she had a patient who gave birth two years ago at age 53 after losing a child, while in July, a 61-year-old gave birth after her only daughter died of disease at 30. "
"Actress Kriti Sanon has said that when she was struggling to enter films, somebody told her she was too good-looking and there have to be imperfections for looking real onscreen.

Kriti made her Bollywood debut with 2014 film 'Heropanti'.","Summarise: Although actor Kriti Sanon is just three films old, she has already been directed by some of the best filmmakers and co-starred with actors such as Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. However, it wasn?t an easy start for her, considering she had to face some bizarre criticism in the aspiring actor phase.?There were some low phases in my life; there were films offered by big banners, but they were not the best debut projects. So, I had to tell myself that I should be patient and good things will happen to me,? says Kriti, who was born and brought up in Delhi and shifted to Mumbai to try her luck in Bollywood.The actor, who turned 27 on Thursday, adds, ?There were days when I was annoyed and irritated. On some days, I used to cry, because there was nothing to keep me busy. There were also times when I met a few people who told me that something was not right about me ? someone told me, ?You?re too good-looking. There has to be some sort of imperfection in you to look real on screen.? I think I did feel low, but at the same time, I did have people who believed in me a lot. That?s what you need. I think that gave me a little more confidence.? Kriti, who made her debut with Tiger Shroff in Heropanti (2014), went on to star in Dilwale (2015) and this year?s Raabta. Her personal life made headlines when she was linked up with her Raabta co-star Sushant Singh Rajput. Neither of them has ever accepted it publicly, and Kriti says that negative stories do affect her.?I think I?ve made peace with all these rumours, but having said that, I?m also human and anything written about me does affect me. Though I know that the news is not true, being written in a negative way does make me feel bad. But it?s more important to move on from such things and focus on something exciting and positive,? says Kriti, who will soon be seen in Bareilly Ki Barfi.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

According to financial experts, the increase in thedefence budget comes in the light of cross border tensions with India, Afghanistan and Iran.Experts also say that though Pakistan Army has been rooting out terrorism from its own soil, through military operations Zarb-e-Azb, Khyber-I, Khyber-II and now Rad-ul-Fasad, tensions between India and Pakistan have only increased. India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants, who infiltrate from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir into the Valley and target Indian security forces. One such attack in September last year killed 18 Indian soldiers and India retaliated with ""surgical strikes"" on terrorist launchpads in PoK. Most recently, the Pakistan Army sentenced Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav on charges of espionage after a secret trial. India had demanded consular access to Jadhav, which Pakistan repeatedly denied, claiming the man was an Indian spy. India and Pakistan are also at loggerheads over a China- backed economic corridor that runs through PoK. China says it is a developmental project and will aid Pakistan's economy.

"President-elect Ram Nath Kovind, who will take the oath as the country's 14th President, talked about his childhood, saying his election to the post ""is to represent all such Kovinds toiling away to make a living"". He was born in an Uttar Pradesh village, and his father had to sell off a piece of his land to fund his education.","Summarise: Ram Nath Kovind was sworn in as India?s 14th president on Tuesday. Kovind, a low-profile politician, will have the task of establishing himself as the first citizen, and not the government?s rubber stamp. Here are key points to know about him. Kovind, 71, was born in a poor family in Paraunkh village in rural Kanpur. The Hindu reports Kovind and his siblings would stick to the corners of their mud hut, as the thatched roof could not stop the rain from pouring into their home. ?My election as President of India is to represent all such Kovinds toiling away to make a living,? he recalled the day he was elected.Kovind?s father was a farmer who had to sell off a piece of land to fund his son?s education in Kanpur. Kovind is a lawyer, who has practised at the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court. Kovind, as a lawyer, worked to provide free legal aid to the poor and Dalits. Kovind?s Dalit identity is a ?matter of fact? but that?s just one part, says the BJP. ?If at all Kovind represents any section, it is that of the majority of India--rural, agrarian, economically and socially underprivileged. It is the same section that Prime Minister Narendra Modi represents. He too was sneered at by some Lutyens? intellectuals as ?chaiwala?. But both Kovind and Modi represent the true India - Marx?s proletariat and Socrates? philosopher rolled into one,? BJP leader Ram Madhav wrote in an article in The Indian Express.Kovind will be the country?s first president born and brought up in Uttar Pradesh. Zakir Hussain, the third president, was from Uttar Pradesh but he wasn?t born there. Kovind?s election as president is expected to ?repair and consolidate? the BJP?s social base in the state after Yogi Adityanath, a Rajput, was made the chief minister. Prime Minister Narendra Modi represents Varanasi, the UP temple town, in Parliament. President elect Ram Nath Kovind greets people during a ceremony after his election, in Delhi on July 20.

						Kovind unsuccessfully contested assembly elections twice and Lok Sabha polls once. He was elected to Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh in 1994 and served two consecutive terms. He spoke on a variety of subjects in Rajya Sabha: from adult movies on TV to a sensitive report on the 1962 war. Kovind posed 283 questions during the two terms in Rajya Sabha. Media profiles written after the National Democratic Alliance selected Kovind as its presidential nominee described him as ?soft-spoken, low profile, unassuming and affable?. It is perhaps Kovind?s style of politics that led Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to back him for the president?s office though the JD(U) leader had criticised his appointment as the state?s governor in 2015. When Kovind visited his village in Uttar Pradesh in 2001, people presented him 11 silver crowns and tried to weigh him in coins. He politely refused both, asking if their love was limited to mere symbolism. He got the silver crowns sold and used the money to marry off 20 women in the village. Kovind, as BJP?s national spokesperson between 2010 and 2012, addressed just three press conferences. ?Heavyweight spokesmen overshadowed him,? a BJP leader who worked with Kovind in the media department told Hindustan Times. Kovind held a press conference in March 2010 which created controversy when he was named for the presidential race. Kovind reportedly rejected a commission?s report recommending reservation for religious minorities. ?Islam and Christianity are alien to the nation,? he reportedly said at the press conference. But his supporters say he was misquoted and he actually said ?notion?. Kovind could be a gentleman politician but as president he doesn?t have to a rubber stamp of the government. There is no constitutional provision that obliges the president to act on the ?aid and advice? of the Cabinet. As this opinion article notes: ?Through the intelligent use of power of reconsideration of the Cabinet?s advice (like KR Narayanan did) and the use of pocket veto and right to be informed like Zail Singh, Kovind can fulfill his oath and enhance the stature his office.?Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah selected Kovind for the job around the first week of June, but Kovind himself was unaware of his candidature till June 17, reports India Today. When a source close to Shah asked him on May 30 whether Union minister Thawar Chand Gehlot was to be the NDA candidate, he was told: ?Someone like him.?Kovind?s family stays away from the limelight. His wife, Savita, called him for hours before she could speak to him after he was declared the NDA?s presidential candidate on June 19. Kovind?s daughter, Swati, is an air hostess with Air India and his son, Prashant, owns a petrol pump.Dog lovers will take pride in President Kovind. An India Today report notes that when Kovind and his family lived at 144 North Avenue, New Delhi, they adopted six stray dogs. Will these dogs move to Rashtrapati Bhavan now?"
"A restaurant owner in Italy has been offering families a 5% discount if their children are well-behaved. Antonio Ferrari, who does not have children of his own, estimated that about 30% of parents do not know how to handle their children at lunchtime. However, the 40-year-old said he was not being judgemental, adding, ""I imagine how difficult parenting is today.""","Summarise: An Italian restaurateur fed up with his customers? lunches being interrupted by rowdy children has come up with a novel solution: a discount for well-behaved families.Antonio Ferrari, who owns a wine bar in the northern city of Padua that caters to families on Sundays, came up with the idea when he spotted a party of 11 at one of his tables, including five children sitting ?with much composure?.Ferrari rewarded the group with a 5% sconto, and has since bestowed the same discount on two other families with well-mannered children.Ferrari told the Guardian he estimated about 30% of parents did not know how to handle their children at lunchtime, and that too often children run around the restaurant and bother other customers, forcing his waiting staff to swerve to avoid them.Long family lunches, sometimes stretching to three hours, are still an honoured culinary and social tradition in Italy, though less prevalent than they once were. Usually the meal involves an antipasto ? bruschetta or platters of prosciutto are fairly typical ? and then a pasta dish, followed by a meat dish and then vegetables.Unlike the disciplined French children portrayed by Pamela Druckerman in her book Bringing up BÃ©bÃ© who sit quietly through restaurant meals as their parents engage in adult conversation, Italian families are stereotypically more rowdy, with loud behaviour often indulged by parents who see it as as a normal childhood phenomenon.  Ferrari ? who does not have children ? was at pains to point out that his intention was not to be too judgmental, telling Corriere della Sera: ?I imagine how difficult parenting is today.?Nevertheless, he thought something had to be done to rein-in children splashing water in the restaurant?s bathrooms and bothering other customers by running around tables.He recalled some parents telling him his restaurant was essentially public, and that they could do what they want. But he added: ?I?m responsible for what happens in it.?The party who earned the coveted discount were delighted by the news and left a ?30 (Â£25) tip, Ferrari said. "

"After the Supreme Court upheld death penalty to four Nirbhaya gangrape convicts, one convict's sister said that anyone can make mistakes and should be given a second chance. Claiming that it is not always the boy's fault, she added that the girls too provoke guys. She further said that despite having a tainted image, she still loves her brother Pawan.","Summarise: In a one bedroom set in the narrow lanes of Ravi Das Camp in RK Puram, that has a small kitchen and an LED TV fixed on the distempered wall, lives the family of Pawan Gupta - one of the four convicts, who will be hanged till death in the Nirbhaya gang rape case.His parents were at the court while his younger sister (name withheld), who has taken class 10 examination, stayed back at home. She was sitting right in front of the television when the news broke on the Supreme Court's verdict.In a high-tone, she told Mail Today that every one commits crime in India and anyone can do a mistake. And at least, he should be given a second chance to rectify it. ""But the court has not given a second chance to my brother,"" she said.When asked about the brutality of the crime committed by his brother in 2012, she said: ""Ladki hassi toh fassi"" adding that it is not always the boy's fault. The girls too provoke them. ""Even I wear jeans and other western clothes. If a guy stares at me or passes any comment, I simply look down and walk away. But, if I start enjoying it then the boy will think that I am giving him a signal,"" she said defending his brother's act.""After the arrest of Pawan, my family has shattered. We have sent the youngest brother, who is 8-year-old, to an undisclosed location, so that he does not have to face regular harassment from locals and peer groups. We have already lost one of our sisters, who was 16-year-old when she died due to mental trauma, she was undergoing after the incident.""I haven't met my brother since February 2016, when he came back to attend the last rites of my sister. Whenever my parents go to Tihar jail to meet him, they don't take me along saying that there are bad people in the jail,"" she added.""I have lost all my school friends because of the tainted image but I still love my brother,"" she said in a choked voice.

Some said it's a right decision while others second the accused saying that they all are neighbours and they have a soft corner for them."
"Government Upper Primary Sanskrit School in Rajasthan's Sikar district has six classrooms, four teachers but not a single student. The student strength of the school, established in 1998, peaked to 55 in 2005 and then began to decline. Reportedly, the teachers now report for work at 8 am, water plants, read newspapers, chat among themselves and leave by 2 pm.","Summarise: From a distance, this government-run Sanskrit school in Sikar district of Rajasthan appears like any other run-down school with the building in need of paint. But once you enter the premises, it becomes clear that something else is amiss. The school is erringly quiet ? there are no children on the small playground or, for that matter, in the classrooms.The Government Upper Primary Sanskrit School in Pratappura village has six classrooms, four teachers ? but not a single student. The teachers report for work at about 8am, water the plants, read newspaper, chat among themselves and leave after 2pm. They get their salary on time, but are not happy about the state of affairs.?We feel ashamed to be sitting idle the whole day. It was once a thriving school with more than 50 students, but things changed a few years ago,? Sanwarmal, the school?s head teacher, told HT.The school, which was established in 1998 attracted children from the neighbouring villages. In 2005, the student strength peaked to 55 and then gradually began to decline. In 2015-16 academic session, only four students were left and their parents also withdrew them last year. ?A few years ago, the neighbouring villages did not have schools so the children used to come to Pratappura. Now, there are three middle schools within 1-2 km range, and so this school has been deserted,? village sarpanch, Balram Verma, said.Pratappura has a population of about 300, and in most households the head of the family are employed in other towns and only the elders have stayed back to look after the ancestral home. ?The village has only six to seven students from class 1-8 who now study in other schools in the neighbouring villages,? Sanwarmal said.All the teachers are now sick with boredom. ?There is nothing to do here. We even encourage the village elders to come and chat with us so that we are able to pass the time,? Krishna Verma, who is the sole female teacher, said.A retired army man, Kashiram and a farmer, Ghanshyam Singh, are regular visitors.The teachers have approached the education department in Jaipur to shift them on deputation to other nearby schools where there is vacancy for Sanskrit teachers. ?We gave a written request many months ago, but no action has been taken in this regard. We were told that deputations have been stopped for now,? Sanwarmal said. The school has a glorious past, said Prabhudayal Sharma, who joined as a teacher in 2003. ?Some of the students have become doctors and engineers and one of them is a senior police official. But now there is little hope. The chances of the school?s revival are very slim,? he said.As if to emphasise his point, a stray dog wanders inside the premises to be quickly shooed away by one of the teachers."

"The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) officials claimed that they fixed 685 potholes in Mumbai so far this month. The MMRDA said that it filled 423 potholes on the 26.5-km Western Express Highway and 212 potholes on the 23.5-km Eastern Express Highway. However, residents complained about the use of the outdated technology and faulty methods to fix the potholes.  ","Summarise: The heavy rains that lashed Mumbai last week caused numerous potholes across the island city and the suburbs, which led to hellish commutes for lakhs of Mumbaiites. Officials from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is in charge of maintaining both the city?s highways, claimed they were filling in craters during the dry spell.The MMRDA said it fixed 353 potholes on the Western Express Highway, which were reported between July 1 and July 10, last week. In the next two days, 70 more potholes found on the highway were filled. Between July 1 and July 18, 212 potholes were filled on Eastern Express Highway, an official said.Dilip Kawathkar, joint project director, MMRDA, said, ?Since then there have been around 50 potholes found on the main carriageway of both the roads. Since there is a dry spell now, we are filling the potholes regularly.??In the past five to six days there have been many potholes found on the two express highways. We are consolidating figures from contractors and also seeing to it that they are filled in,? said an engineer, who did not wish to be named. While officials claim that they have been fixing potholes regularly, questions are being raised about the outdated technology and faulty methods being used. Many residents and activists complained that instead of cold-mix technology, MMDRA was using paver blocks to fix potholes. They also said MMRDA?s response times were slow.?Cold mix is used to fill potholes, but as soon as it rains heavily the mix washes away. At certain places we have used paver blocks. Though it is not a standard practice, in our experience it lasts longer,? the engineer said. The MMRDA has appointed two contractors to maintain the 23.5-km Eastern Express Highway and, four contractors to maintain the 26.5-km Western Express Highway during the monsoon.Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to not even count the number of potholes on the roads it is supposed to maintain or reveal the number of complaints it has received. Officials only said that they had attended to ?90%? of complaints."

"In 2015 the Supreme Court appointed a panel headed by Justice RM Lodha to determine punishments for those found guilty in 2013's IPL spot-fixing scandal. The panel was also tasked to propose changes to the way BCCI was structured and governed, in order to prevent sporting frauds and conflict of interests among other issues that concerned the court.","Summarise: The Board of Control for Cricket in India has finally had to pay for ignoring Supreme Court's order by not implementing the Lodha Committee reforms as the board president Anurag Thakur and secretary Ajay Shirke have been sacked from their posts by the top court. The apex court on Monday fired the BCCI top brass, and asked Thakur and Shirkey to demit office. All BCCI office bearers who have not followed the norms of Lodha panel to demit office. The Apex court has also issued a show cause notice to Anurag Thakur and Shirkey and asked why they should not be tried for perjury and contempt. Â  The BCCI and the SC-appointed Lodha Panel have been at loggerheads for a while now. It all started when the spot-fixing scandal broke out during the Indian Premier League in 2013 leading to developments that forced the top court to intervene.Subsequently, the Mudgal Committee was appointed by the Supreme Court, which submitted its report and pointed out irregularities pertaining to the IPL. To help things move further, the Supreme Court appointed a panel in January 2015 headed by former Chief Justice of India, RM Lodha. In July, the panel suspended IPL franchises Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) for two years, while the teams' co-owners Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra were banned for life from cricket. (BCCI refuses to blink again, says will not accept Lodha reforms in totality)Later, the Lodha panel suggested a set of comprehensive reforms for the BCCI to implement. A few of those recommendations were challenged by BCCI and then the apex court had a final word and set a deadline for the the board to implement the suggested reforms in its totality. But, the BCCI continued to stand its ground. Meanwhile, the apex court also asked Thakur to file an affidavit to explain why he had asked the ICC to interfere in the proceedings and submit it to the court on October 17. SGM's were held and the BCCI decided to decline certain orders of the Lodha panel. (BCCI setting dangerous precedent with its defiance of Supreme Court)After the continued defiance, the Lodha committee asked the Supreme Court to sack the 'top brass' of the BCCI and install former Home Secretary GK Pillai as an observer of the BCCI with power to appoint an auditor, and guide the BCCI administration, particularly on the award of contracts and on transparency. With BCCI standing firm continuously with only three state associations - Hyderabad, Vidarbha and Tripura - agreeing to implement the recommendations in full. (Supreme Court to BCCI chief Anurag Thakur: Apologise or go to jail for perjury)The Supreme Court in its latest hearing threatened the BCCI president Anurag Thakur that he can land in serious trouble as the Supreme Court said he should go to jail over his attempt to obstruct justice following his approach to the ICC for writing to the Supreme Court for government intervention.As the New Year kicks in, the BCCI vs Lodha stand-off may finally come to an end as the court is scheduled to give its final verdict today. Let's have a look at how the developments took place over the years in the battle between BCCI and Lodha:MAY 2013: SPOT-FIXING SCANDALThe arrest of S Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila (all Rajasthan Royals' players) on spot-fixing charges revealed a nexus between bookies, players and franchise members. CSK team principal, Meiyappan was arrested after being questioned for spot-fixing charges.OCTOBER 2013: SC APPOINTS MUDGAL COMMITTEE To further investigate the spot-fixing scandal and to a matter of BCCI, Supreme Court appointed a committee headed by Justice Mukul Mudgal.NOVEMBER 2014: CSK, RR FOUND GUILTY The Mudgal committee found that IPL COO Sundar Raman, Meiyappan and Kundra were guilty for betting. In its report, Mudgal also mentioned about then BCCI chief N Srinivasan, who didn't take any actions against them despite knowing about their violations.JANUARY 2015: SC APPOINTS LODHA PANEL The Supreme Court appointed another panel headed by Justice (Retd) RM Lodha to determine punishments for those found guilty in IPL spot-fixing scandal. The Lodha panel was also tasked to suggest reforms for BCCI. (BCCI's key differences with the Lodha panel)JULY 2015: LODHA PANEL SUSPENDS CSK AND RR FOR 2 YEARSThe Lodha panel in a landmark judgement suspended CSK and RR for two years and banned its owners for life. However, players of both the franchises were allowed to be auctioned for other franchises.JANUARY 2016: PANEL RECOMMENDS COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF BCCIThe Lodha panel recommended sweeping changes to the board's power structure. The recommendations included - one-vote-one-state criteria, limiting tenure of office bearers and also barring ministers over 70 holding any position in the board or state associations.The panel also suggested to set up a separate players' associations (men and women).FEBRUARY 2016: SUPREME COURT SETS DEADLINE FOR BCCILodha panel had given BCCI time till January 31 to get back with suggestions, but they didn't and forcing the committee to knock Supreme Court's door. The apex court gave the board a deadline till March 3 to respond to guidelines suggested by Lodha panel.FEBRUARY 2016: BCCI POINTS OUT OBJECTIONS TO LODHA REPORTBCCI and the state cricket associations had problems in implementing few of key recommendations made by Lodha panel. The board had objections to the one-state-one-vote and the ""cooling off"" period. The Lodha panel also suggested for a three-member selection committee, to which the BCCI had objections.MARCH 2016: BCCI DETAILS RESERVATION AGAINST REPORTIn a 55-page counter-affidavit submitted in the court, BCCI stated that it partially accepted some of the reforms, but had concerns on many of the recommendations presented by the Lodha panel.APRIL 2016: COURT SLAMS BCCI'S DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDSThe Supreme Court criticised BCCI's method of disbursing funds to state associations saying it was being done without any particular mechanism. During this particular hearing, the court also turned down BCCI's request to review one-state-one-vote recommendation made by Lodha panel.MAY 2016: COURT CALLS BCCI CONSTITUTION NON TRANSPARENTThe Supreme Court observed that the BCCI's constitution was incapable of achieving the values of transparency, objectivity and accountability.While hearing a matter related to implementation of Lodha reforms by BCCI, the Supreme Court said: ""The inherent constitution of the BCCI is such that it is highly incapable of achieving the values of transparency, objectivity and accountability (such) that without changing its structure it can't be done so.""SEPTEMBER 2016: PANEL MAKES PLEA TO REPLACE BCCI TOP BRASSLodha Committee asked the Supreme Court to direct the ""immediate"" supercession of the current BCCI top brass for blatant violations of the July 18 Supreme Court judgment directing them to implement the panel's recommendations for transparency in cricket administration.SEPTEMBER 2016: SC ASKS BCCI TO 'FALL IN LINE' OR FACE ACTIONReferring to Justice RM Lodha's suggestion to remove BCCI's top brass, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India TS Thakur blasted the cricket board. ""BCCI thinks they are a law unto themselves. They are wrong. You behave like lords. Fall in line or else we will make you.""OCTOBER 2016: BCCI HOLDS SGM, REJECT CERTAIN REFORMSBCCI rejected some of the Supreme Court's key recommendations aimed at administrative reform. The BCCI, after a marathon special general meeting, said in a statement it had adopted ""important recommendations"" made by the committee but made no mention of the age and tenure recommendations nor a ""one state/one vote"" policy.OCTOBERÂ  2016: BCCI DISBURSES FUNDS TO STATE ASSOCIATIONSBCCI after a emergent meeting decided to distribute Rs 1,100 crore to state associations. But on learing the development, Lodha panel stepped in and asked the banks to stop disbursing money to state associations. BCCI president Anurag Thakur told in a press conference that the third Test between India and New Zealand in Indore is in jeopardy because of this order. However, Justice Lodha himself clarified that banks will release funds required for daily operation of the board and the Indore Test doesn't faces the threat of being called off.OCTOBER 2016: SUBMIT UNCONDITIONAL UNDERTAKING, THEN WE WON'T PASS ORDERThe apex court decided to pass an order on the issue of implementation of directions of the Lodha committee after BCCI declined to give an ""unconditional undertaking.OCTOBER 2016: SC GIVES INTERIM ORDER, STOPS FUNDS TO STATE ASSOCIATIONSThe Supreme Court barred BCCI from releasing any funds to its state affiliates until they give an unconditional undertaking that they will comply with the organisational reforms as recommended by the Justice Lodha Committee.OCTOBER 2016: SC ASKS THAKUR TO FILE AFFIDAVIT ON TALKS WITH ICCThe Supreme Court directed Thakur to file an affidavit and clarify whether he had asked the ICC to write that Lodha Recommendations amounted to government interference. This was reportedly claimed by ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson in some recent media interactions.OCTOBER 2016: BCCI HOLDS MEET, MEMBERS REJECT CERTAIN REFORMS At a SGM, the BCCI agreed to implement some important recommendations but they remained defiant of some key reforms. The members decided that the age restriction of 70 years for board officials, the tenure cap of nine years with cooling-off periods, and the one-state-one-vote policy, among others can't be implemented.NOVEMBER 2016: PANEL URGES SC TO REMOVE BCCI TOP BRASSAfter continued defiance, the RM Lodha committee recommended the sacking of all office bearers of the BCCI and its state associations.NOVEMBER 2016: PANEL URGES SC TO APPOINT GK PILLAI AS BCCI OBSERVERThe Supreme Court suggested the appointment of former Home Secretary Gopal Krishna Pillai as an observer in the apex body. In a fresh status report filed to the Supreme Court, the panel asked that Pillai be appointed as observer with power to appoint an auditor, and guide the BCCI administration, particularly on the award of contracts and on transparency.DECEMBER 2016: BCCI HOLD MEET, CONTINUES TO OPPOSE REFORMSBCCI secretary Ajay Shirke said there was no change in their stand on the recommendations made by the RM Lodha Panel after a meeting.Only three state associations - Hyderabad, Vidarbha and Tripura - had agreed to implement the recommendations in full, while others rejected it. DECEMBER 2016: SC SLAMS BCCI PRESIDENT FOR APPROACHING ICCBCCI president Anurag Thakur landed in serious trouble after the Supreme Court said he should go to jail over his attempt to obstruct justice.Thakur had, according to International Cricket Council CEO Dave Richardson, asked the international cricket body chairman to furnish the Indian board with a letter that indicated the Supreme Court order was like government intervention. The ICC does not allow government intervention in the functioning of its member boards and they could even be suspended. However, Thakur and BCCI have denied asking for any such letter from the ICC. DECEMBER 2016: BCCI IN PROBLEM, FINAL VERDICT ON JANUARY 2BCCI president Anurag Thakur conceded that the current crisis facing the board is not in the best interest of cricketers but the body will have to keep everything on hold till Supreme Court gives it's verdict on January 2."
"Madhya Pradesh Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has announced compensation of ?1 crore to the families of security personnel from the state who are killed in the line of duty. ""We will provide them a house, a job to a family member, erect a statue of the martyr and name a road after him/her,? Chouhan added. ","Summarise: Madhya Pradesh Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced in the state assembly that the government from now on will give Rs one crore as compensation to the family members of anyone from the state who attains martyrdom for the country.Speaking on the adjournment moved by the Opposition Congress party on the Mandsaur police firing in which six farmers were killed, Chouhan said, ""Opposition members are questioning me. Asking why I gave compensation of Rs one crore to those whose family members died in the police firing. I just want to say I have my own style of working. I want to make this announcement right now. I hope I never have to do this but god forbid if anyone from the state gets martyred, my government will give a compensation of Rs one crore to the family members.""Earlier speaking on the adjournment, leader of Opposition, Ajay Singh charged the government of trivialising the issue and refuted charges of the Congress party's role in the violence. ""The government is charging us with indulging in violence. We were not part of the agitation from day one but yes we stood by the farmers after six of them were killed in police firing.Â  We still stand with the farmers and the government should accept that it was failure on the part of its machinery,"" he said.Ajay Singh also raised the issue of farmers committing suicide across the state and read out names of farmers who committed suicide in the chief minister's home district after June 6. ""Had the state government legislated the moneylender's act as was announced in 2011, the situation would never had arisen as most of the farmers are committing suicide after getting into a debt trap,"" he said.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in return read out the figures of suicides committed by farmers during the Congress' rule.

"Days after the Centre banned the sale of cattle for slaughter in the animal markets across the country, cows are being sold online on e-marketplaces such as OLX. ""It's too dangerous keeping cows anymore. Anyone can come and beat us,"" said a cattle owner adding that he was open to a distress sale for 50% less than the market price.","Summarise: Hamstrung by the government's restrictions on sale of cattle, farmers and livestock traders have found greener pastures in digital India. So, a swift search on online marketplaces such as OLX shows that hundreds of cows are up for sale in the virtual world.The environment ministry decreed last week that animal markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing and dairy production. The rule came as part of a tough new law against animal cruelty, but critics say they are aimed at placating hardline Hindu supporters of the Narendra Modi government. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday suspended the order for four weeks.Ravi Sharma from Uttar Pradesh's holy city Varanasi, which Prime Minister Modi represents in Parliament, seemed a little wary when spoken to about his online post selling a desi brown cow for Rs 75,000. He first wanted to know what this correspondent intended to do with it and what community she belonged to, categorically stating that he has no interest in selling to a certain minority group.Not far away from Varanasi, in Ghazipur, Bheem Singh is keen to get rid of three cows at the earliest. So much so that he is open to a distress sale for as much as 50 per cent less than the market price for cows. ""It's too dangerous keeping cows any more. Anyone can come and beat us,"" he said while pushing this correspondent to close the deal over the phone.The past two years have seen a rise in vigilante attacks on Muslims and lower caste Hindus involved in the cattle trade, leading to several deaths. A group of alleged ""cow protectors"" thrashed two meat traders on the suspicion that they were carrying beef on May 26. Police in Rajasthan's Bhilwara arrested five people, including an alleged member of the RSS - the BJP's ideological mentor - who torched a truck last week that they thought was carrying cows for slaughter.Several state governments have appealed to the PM to repeal the order, which they say was issued without consultations with them. Some have decided to drag the Centre to court. Environment minister Harsh Vardhan had said that cattle bought and sold directly from farms would not be affected by the government's order. ""The aim of the rules is only to regulate the animal market and sale of cattle in them and ensure (the) welfare of cattle"" in the markets,"" he had said. But many commentators see the move as a blow to beef and leather exports that will leave hundreds of thousands jobless and deprive millions of Christians, Muslims and poor Hindus of a cheap source of protein.It's not that cows have not been sold on e-commerce websites before. They have been available occasionally under the pets section. But there has been a sudden surge since the BJP swept to power in Uttar Pradesh in March with priest-turned politician Yogi Adityanath taking the chief minister's post, and the rise of the gau rakshaks, or cow vigilantes."
"In a bid to avoid additional pressure on the troops, outgoing CRPF Director General K Durga Prasad has refused the ceremonial farewell parade planned for his retirement. ""As such the CRPF is stretched. Then is the additional responsibility of ongoing elections,"" the 1981 batch IPS officer said. He instead visited the troops and tried to address their concerns, Prasad added.","Summarise: A step to ease some pressure from a vast body of stressed troops has been taken.In what many have termed an 'unprecedented departure from an age-old norm', the Director General of the India's biggest central armed police force, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), K Durga Prasad has declined a farewell parade being planned for his retirement at the end of the month. This is, in his own words, keeping the 'convenience of the force in mind'.From being deployed for the conduct of elections to supporting counter-insurgency operations to aiding the police, the 239-battalion strong CRPF is among the most extensively deployed forces.WHY NO FAREWELL PARADEIn his first reaction, K Durga Prasad, a 1981 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer said, ""As such the CRPF is stretched. Then is the additional responsibility of ongoing elections. In this, a farewell parade would have meant that my personnel would be committed for an extended period to duties which are ceremonial in nature"". Instead, ""I visited my troops where they are, heard them and am trying to address their issues"", he said. Travelling over weekends, clearing files till late in the evening in office and camping for night halts between troop locations is indeed a norm for the present DG. He asked his staff to arrange a simple Guard of Honour to mark the end of his career. Â Durga Prasad enjoys the reputation of being a hands-on leader with his ear to the ground. From taking the Maoists head-on in united Andhra Pradesh as the leader of 'Greyhounds' force, he also held charge of the elite Special Protection Group (SPG) between November 2011 and November 2014. He also, as the Inspector General (IG), played a role in raising CRPF's own commando force, CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action). His choice, to many, reflects an acknowledgement of something being amiss.Also read | Exclusive: CRPF working on mobile app for its 3 lakh jawans Â  A uniformed force functions on the principle of alternative posting for its personnel. From areas considered 'hard', personnel should be posted to areas considered 'soft'. This so that adequate rest, recuperation and training can be provided. However, forces like the CRPF have almost junked this principle. Rest, recuperation and training have been reduced merely to concepts on paper, say insiders. ""From a 50 per cent divide into hard and soft areas, the CRPF is more than 80 per cent into hard areas. Where is the room for respite?"", asked an informed source. DURGA PRASAD'S MOVE WELCOMEDAn officer of the CRPF, who has previously organised farewell parades termed Durga Prasad's decision a 'welcome move'. He recounted, ""For about a month, nearly 1,000 troops pooled in from all across the country march up and down in practice for the farewell parade at the CRPF training academy near Gurugram. In comparison, a Guard of Honour will involve not more than 100 troops"". DC Dey is a highly-regarded veteran, who retired as the Additional Director General of the CRPF. In his opinion, Durga Prasad's move deserves to be 'commended'. ""Someone retiring as a DG definitely deserves a show. However, very few outside have an idea of how much stress the force personnel are under. When elections are around the corner, we cancel all leaves""."

"The Rashtrapati Bhavan, the residence of India's President, took 17 years to finish building, and was earlier the Viceroy's House. The complex has a total of 340 rooms, spread over four floors, and an area of 2,00,000 square feet. A part of the complex are the Mughal Gardens, one of the world's best rose gardens with over 150 varieties.","Summarise: Ram Nath Kovind, the BJP's candidate for the presidential election, secured an easy win against Opposition pick Meira Kumar today to be elected as the 14th President of India. Â  The former Bihar governor, who was born in Kanpur, will take the oath of office on July 25 and move to Rashtrapati Bhavan. Outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee will leave for his new residence at 10, Rajaji Marg.When Ram Nath Kovind enters Rashtrapati Bhavan, he will step into a building that was transformed from an imperial mansion into an institution of democracy on January 26, 1950. When Dr Rajendra Prasad occupied the building as country's first President, the Viceroy's House was renamed as Rashtrapati Bhavan. THE MAKING OF RASHTRAPATI BHAVANThe initial amount sanctioned for the construction of Rashtrapati Bhavan was 400,000 pounds. It took 17 years to finish building the Rashtrapati Bhavan in 1929 and by then the construction cost had escalated to 877,136 pounds (In 1929, this was Rs 1.28 crore approx).Add to that the cost of constructing Mughal Garden and the staff quarters, the total cost of building the entire Rashtrapati Bhavan complex stood at Rs 1.4 crore approx.The Rashtrapati Bhavan has a total of 340 rooms spread on four floors. The mansion has a floor area of 200,000 square feet and was built with 700 million bricks and three million cubic feet of stone. The Rashtrapati Bhavan was built using almost no steel. THE INDO-EUROPEAN ARCHITECTUREEdwin Lutyens acknowledged the influence of Roman architecture in Rashtrapati Bhavan. Yet, the building also reflects various motifs from Indian architecture, such as chhatris and jaalis. Temple bells have been used in the pillars of Rashtrapati Bhavan, an idea that came from a Jain temple in Moodabidri in Karnataka. THE MUGHAL GARDENThe Mughal Garden boasts of 250 varieties of roses, making it one of the best rose gardens in the world. Ram Nath Kovind will organise 'At Homes' on Republic Day and Independence Day every year in the Central Lawn.The lawns in the main garden are covered with 'Doob' grass which was originally brought from Belvedere Estate in Kolkata. Peacocks are a regular sight at the Mughal Garden, while once in a while a cormorant can also be spotted. PRESIDENT's BODYGUARDThe President's Bodyguard was raised in 1773 by then Governor Warren Hastings in Benares. The regiment was formed as a select cavalry unit with the role to ""act as bodyguard to the governor in peace and to accompany him as Commander-in-Chief in battle"". The President's Bodyguard excel in ceremonial procedures, are trained as combat paratroopers and armoured vehicle crewmen.THE PRESIDENTIAL RETREATSThe President of India has two retreats in the country--one in Mashobra, Shimla and the other in Bolarum, Hyderabad. Ram Nath Kovind, who was denied entry to the Retreat Building in Shimla two months ago, is set to be the custodian of the presidential retreat. The presidential retreat in Shimla is an entirely wooden structure and is located on the hill top of Mashobra. The presidential retreat in Hyderabad, called the Rashtrapati Nilayam, is an 1860-built building with 11 rooms. The building was taken over from the Nizam of Hyderabad after Independence and handed over to President's secretariat. The President stays at both the retreats at least once in a year.

"Delhi village Kadipur has free WiFi with 24-hour connectivity but lacks basic civic amenities like regular water supply. The village, which was adopted by BJP MP Manoj Tiwari in 2014, also faces issues like broken roads and choked drains. ""It would have been better if the government fixed this (water supply) instead of spending on internet connectivity,"" a resident said.","Summarise: Kadipur, a small village in northwest Delhi, has free WiFi facility with 25 servers providing 24-hour internet connectivity. But when it comes to basic civic amenities, the village has nothing to show.  The village, with a population of about 800, is battling broken roads, inconsistent water supply and choked drains. Saurav Verma, 18, a student of Delhi University and resident of Kadipur village, has to wake up at 5 in the morning every alternate day, and wait an hour till the water tank is filled up. Verma, and most other residents of the village, say while the WiFi facility may have waited, the government should have first ensured regular water supply, an approach road and improved connectivity.Kadipur was declared a ?free Wi-Fi? village on June 19 by the local councillor Urmila Rana. Villagers access the facility by registering their phone numbers on which they get security code to log in.Delhi BJP chief and Northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari had adopted Kadipur village under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojna in 2014.A month after the WiFi facility was launched, Hindustan Times visited the village and found that while the internet facility was working fine, most villagers were disappointed with the civic infrastructure.?We get only two hours of water supply that too every alternate day. It would have been better if the government would fixed this instead of spending on improving internet connectivity,? Verma said.It takes Verma at least two hours to reach Delhi University (North Campus) as connectivity to different parts of the city from the village is poor. The villagers have to hail shared vans to reach the main road 5 km away from where they get transport.  Though the internal roads were fine, the approach roads to the village are dust bowls with waterlogging at some places.Another resident, who did not wish to be identified, said, ?There are times when we could not sleep whole night because there are warehouses here where movement of trucks continue entire night. We complained to the local councillor but nothing happened. The politicians focus on populist measures while the basic infrastructure is crumbling.?He said that the drains are clogged and water overflows at several places.?The mobile connectivity is not a big issue. Children in the village anyway had mobile phones with internet facility. We are not dependent on government for WiFi,? he said.Anil Kashyap, another resident, said things have improved a bit.  ?There has been some development in the past few years. He said earlier the villagers have to wait five days for getting water supply.?He said improved connectivity will create better employment opportunities for the village youth, he said.Area councillor Urmila Rana said she has written to the Delhi government several times for improving the water supply but nothing has happened. ?I would have got the roads constructed but the corporation is yet to notify the newly drawn municipal zones because of which no development funds could be allocated.?Manoj Tiwari told Hindustan Times that it was for the Delhi government to take care of problems related to water and power. ?I have adopted the village and my funds will be used for the purpose. But I can only suggest or recommend the work but the government will have to do it. The problem persists because of the government?s non-cooperative attitude. I am hurt that I cannot do much despite efforts,? he said. "

Ranjan said that Babla was wanted by the special cell, Delhi Police?s anti-terror squad, in a case when he had escaped from the custody of the Punjab police while being produced at the Tis Hazari Court in Delhi in 2004. ?A case was registered at the Subzi Mandi police station and the probe was handed over to the special cell. Babla was wanted by us (Delhi Police) in that case and the court had declared him a proclaimed offender,? said Ranjan, adding he had escaped again from Punjab police custody at Bhilwara railway station in Rajasthan in 1986.According to the joint CP, Babla?s arrest came following information that he would come to Mahipalpur area to meet some criminals with whom he was planning to commit bank and ATM robberies in the city. ?Our team laid a trap and caught Babla from near Shiv Murti on NH-8 with a pistol and four rounds,? Ranjan said adding Babla was also in touch with Jagtar Singh Hawara and other top leaders of Sikh militant groups who are lodged in different jails.A native of Ludhiana in Punjab, DCP Bhisham Singh said, Babla joined Bhindranwale-led militant group in 1982, almost two years after his elder brother Swaran Singh became a militant.

"'Lipstick Under My Burkha' director Alankrita Shrivastava has said the censors have a problem with female point of view, while adding, ""They're...not comfortable with something that questions...the status quo."" She also said that the male perspective which dominates popular culture, has led to discrimination against women and ""makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment...abuse of women okay"".","Summarise: A Bollywood director whose ?lady oriented? film was blocked by censors has hit back at the movie establishment, saying it needs more women at the top to battle deep-rooted Indian prejudice. ?The censors have a problem with a female point of view; they?re just not comfortable with something that questions or disturbs the status quo,? said Alankrita Shrivastava, whose film has now overcome its critics and will be released in Indian cinemas on Friday.Shrivastava said popular culture was shaped by man?s perspective, and it was therefore important to encourage more women directors, artists and storytellers. Her movie - which profiles women who break free from tradition - stars a Muslim woman and a middle-aged widow among its unlikely heroines.Shrivastava battled hard on social media for its release after India?s censor board refused to certify Lipstick Under My Burkha, calling the film ?lady oriented?.Shrivastava appealed the decision with the film certification tribunal, which said the film could be released with an adult certification and after minor cuts. Relating the story of four women who want to realise their dreams, the movie has sparked a debate in India over what is permissible in movies and how women are actually portrayed. ?Our popular culture, our cinema is largely a product of the male gaze, for the male gaze,? she said.?Art and popular culture are powerful tools we can use to have a conversation about perspective and conditioning. It can force us to think differently, see a different point of view.?Women film directors in India?s Bollywood, just as in Hollywood, make up only a small fraction of the industry. Churning out about 1,000 films a year, Bollywood is largely known for its formulaic fare of action flicks and syrupy romances with elaborate song-and-dance sequences.Movies with female protagonists and stories that challenge gender stereotypes are still rare. This has a far-reaching effect on audiences, said Shrivastava. ?Women are 50 percent of the population; we have a particular way of seeing things, but it is the male perspective that has dominated for so long in popular culture,? she said.?This perspective has led to discrimination against women, violence against women. Our popular culture justifies this perspective, and makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment and abuse of women okay.?Campaigners in India have urged the film industry to stop glorifying stalking and harassment after several violent deaths of women. There has also been a campaign to rewrite Bollywood songs to end gender stereotyping and misogyny in films."

The second issue was that in case JJ Bastis, existing in land belonging to the Central government or agencies like Railway, DDA and others, the respective agency may either carry out the rehabilitation themselves as per the policy of Delhi government or may entrust the job to DUSIB,? said an official.Read more: Delhi to start slum rehab policy from Sangam ParkAs per the policy, the cut-off date is January 1, 2015.

"Real estate baron Gopal Ansal on Monday surrendered before Tihar jail authorities to face one-year jail term in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy case. This comes after the Supreme Court rejected his plea seeking more time to surrender. Notably, 59 persons had died in Uphaar Cinema in Delhi during the screening of Hindi movie 'Border' on June 13, 1997.","Summarise: New Delhi, Mar 20 (PTI) Gopal Ansal surrendered today before Tihar jail authorities to undergo one-year jail term in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy case after the Supreme Court refused to grant him more time. A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul rejected the plea moved by the real estate baron seeking more time to surrender on the ground that he has moved a mercy plea before the President, and had asked him to surrender by this evening. ""Ansal surrendered around 5-5.30 PM. He is currently lodged in the hospital at Jail No. 3 as he complained of some health issues,"" said a jail official. The bench said, ""Sorry, we cant,"" when senior advocate Ram Jethmalani mentioned the matter and sought more time, telling the court that they have already approached the President with their mercy plea. The apex court also rejected the plea from the senior advocate seeking a direction for speedy disposal of his mercy plea, pending before the President, saying that it cannot interfere in it as it is an exclusive jurisdiction of the President. The apex court, on March 9, had dismissed Ansals petition for parity with his elder brother Sushil Ansal, who was awarded jail term already undergone by him considering his ""age-related complications"", and directed him to surrender by today to serve the prison term. 69-year-old Gopal Ansal was in jail earlier for around four-and-a-half-month in connection with the case relating to the June 13, 1997 fire tragedy in which 59 persons had died in Uphaar cinema during the screening of Hindi movie Border. Over 100 people were injured in the subsequent stampede. A bench headed by Justice Gogoi, in a 2:1 majority verdict on February 9, had granted relief to 76-year-old Sushil Ansal considering age-related complications by awarding him the jail term already undergone and had asked Gopal to surrender in four weeks to serve the remaining jail term. Gopal had thereafter approached the apex court seeking modification of its order on the grounds of parity, saying he was 69-year-old and would suffer irreparable damage to his health if sent to prison.

"The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has directed power distribution companies in Delhi to either generate their own electricity through renewable sources or increase their purchase of green energy from generating companies. Reportedly, DERC will make it compulsory for the companies to buy 100% electricity being generated from the waste-to-energy (WTE) plants set up in the capital. ","Summarise: Power distribution companies will now have to procure more green energy or electricity generated from renewable sources.The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has issued a new regulation according to which discoms will either have to generate their own electricity through renewable sources or increase their purchase of green energy from generating companies.The draft rules termed as the ?DERC (Renewable Purchase Obligation and Renewable Energy Certificate Framework Implementation) Regulations, 2017 will also make it compulsory for discoms to buy 100% electricity being generated from the waste-to-energy (WTE) plants set up in the Capital. Currently, Delhi has four WTE plants. ?The distribution licensees shall compulsorily procure 100% power produced from all the Waste-to-Energy plants in the State, in the ratio of their procurement of power from all sources including their own as approved by the Commission from time to time, which shall qualify towards compliance of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for the Distribution Licensee,? read the draft regulations for which comments from public are being sought. People can send their comments to the commission till August 15.?The annual target for RPO required to be met by the discoms shall be notified by the dommission in the tariff order that is likely to be announced in September,? a DERC official said. The DERC in October 2012 had notified regulations making RPO compulsory for all discoms in the city. RPOs make it mandatory for all discoms to purchase some percentage of electricity through renewable sources of energy. In 2016-17, the discoms had to get 9% of their total electricity from renewables and in 2015-16 it was 7.6%.However, since 2012, the power regulator had only been carrying it forward to the next financial year as discoms had repeatedly failed to meet the RPOs.As a result, by the year 2015, the defaulting amount has risen up to almost 15 per cent of the total electricity procured by the companies.After defaulting on RPOs for years and with the Aam Aadmi Party government notifying the Delhi Solar Policy, the city?s three discoms have now pulled up their socks. Tata Power procured 400 MW of solar power and Reliance Infra-backed BSES announced it would procure 700 MW ?green energy? for the city.BSES, which distributes power to 70 per cent of the areas in Delhi, has decided to procure both solar and non-solar power at under Rs5 per unit through the ?reverse auction? route to ensure an ?extremely competitive? rate to benefit consumers."

Ahir said.The minister was responding to a supplementary question by Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, who asked if the central government was planning to modify the CrPC and IPC to deal with mob lynching in the name of cow protection which he said was ?emerging as a trend now?.The minister said the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain a separate data of killings in the name of cow protection.Stressing that law and order was a state subject, Ahir said Home Minister Rajnath Singh had already issued an advisory to all the states to take prompt action in cases of cow vigilantism and nab the culprits.Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agrawal, who had asked the primary question on cow vigilantism, accused ?BJP people? of involvement in such incidents. Ahir objected to the reference to BJP cadres in this connection. Not satisfied with the Minister?s reply, Samajwadi Party MPs walked up to the Chairman?s podium and shouted slogans.?Gau raksha ke naam pe hatya, nahi chalegi (Killings in the name of cow protection won?t be accepted),? they shouted in a chorus as other opposition members stood up at their desks.Chairman Hamid Ansari adjourned the House for 10 minutes amidst sloganeering."
"US Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday said he had opposed commuting the prison sentence of convicted whistleblower Chelsea Manning. President Barack Obama has reduced Manning's 35-year prison term by nearly 29 years. Manning, a former US Army soldier, was convicted in 2013 of espionage and other crimes for leaking classified information while deployed in Iraq.","Summarise: Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday said he had opposed commuting the prison sentence of convicted leaker Chelsea Manning, who was convicted in 2013 of espionage and other crimes for leaking classified information while deployed in Iraq.""That was not my recommendation,"" Carter said in an Associated Press interview. ""I recommended against that, but the president has made his decision.""Carter declined to elaborate on his view.President Barack Obama has drawn intense criticism from members of Congress and others for his decision on Tuesday to commute Manning's 35-year prison sentence to about seven years, including the time she spent locked up before she was convicted. Her sentence is now set to expire May 17.At the time Manning committed the crimes she was known as Bradley Manning and was serving as an Army private.CHARGES AGAINST MANNINGA judge convicted Manning of 20 counts, including six Espionage Act violations, theft and computer fraud. She was sentenced to 35 years out of a possible maximum of 90. She was acquitted of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, which carries a possible life sentence.The now 29-year-old native of Crescent, Okla, leaked more than 700,000 classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and diplomatic cables in 2010 while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad. Manning also leaked a 2007 video clip of a US helicopter crew killing at least nine men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The Pentagon later concluded the helicopter crew acted appropriately, having mistaken the camera equipment for weapons.Also read: Obama shortens sentence of Manning, who gave secrets to WikiLeaks Also read: Julian Assange's lawyer: WikiLeaks founder subjected to 'mental torture' At a White House news conference on Wednesday, Obama firmly defended his Manning decision, arguing she had served a ""tough prison sentence"" already.The White House declined to comment on Carter's remarks but pointed to Obama's explanation about why he'd granted the commutation.WHY DID OBAMA COMMUTE HER SENTENCEObama said his decision took into account the fact that Manning had gone to trial, taken responsibility for her crime and received a sentence that he said was harsher than other leakers had received. He emphasized that he had commuted her sentence, not granted a pardon, which would have symbolically forgiven her for the crime.""I feel very comfortable that justice has been served,"" Obama said, adding, ""A message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work, that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that have been put in place.""Also read: WikiLeaks' Assange should go free from embassy and be compensated: UN panel The president said he does not accept the argument of critics that the commutation sends the wrong message to others in the military.""The notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,"" Obama said.Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Obama's decision on Manning was a mistake and called the convicted leaker a ""traitor.""Pence said in an interview airing Wednesday night with Fox News' Brett Baier that Manning's actions compromised national security, endangered American personnel and compromised individuals in Afghanistan who were cooperating with US forces."

"A German court on Wednesday ruled that the parents of a teenager, who died in 2012 after falling in front of an underground train, had no claim to access her Facebook details or chat history. The family had said it wanted to know whether the girl's death was suicide and, if so, whether it was the consequence of online bullying.","Summarise: The parents of a dead 15-year-old who appealed to Facebook to allow them access to her account to see if she was being bullied before her death have lost their claim in court.Berlin?s court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that the parents of the teenager, who died in 2012 after falling in front of an underground train, had no claim to access her details or chat history. The ruling goes against the decision made in an initial judgment by the regional court in 2015. It raises fresh questions over digital inheritance and who has the right to manage someone?s online presence and intellectual property when they die.The court said it had made the ruling according to the telecommunications secrecy law which precludes heirs from viewing the communications of a deceased relative with a third party. Before the ruling both Facebook and the parents of the girl, whose identity has not been made public, reserved the right in the event of a defeat to take an appeal to Germany?s federal court of justice in Karlsruhe. The judge said they were free to do so, but the parents have not confirmed that this is what they still intend to do.The family have said they are desperate to find out whether the girl?s death in Berlin was suicide and, if so, whether it was the consequence of online bullying. They have said they want Facebook to allow access to chats she might have had online which might provide a clue as to the cause of their daughter?s unexpected death.The girl had reportedly given her mother the login details to her account when she was 14 but the company, having been informed of the girl?s death by one of her Facebook friends, froze or ?memorialised? her account. The move meant that photos and posts the girl had shared remained visible, and friends could pay tribute to her, but it was no longer possible to log in to the account. Facebook has refused to say who applied for the account to be frozen, also citing data protection. The person who lodged the request would have had to provide Facebook with proof that the girl had died. The US social media company has repeatedly rejected the parents? request, arguing that in the event messages from a user are revealed, other users would also be exposed. They argue that the conversations would have taken place on the understanding that their content remained private.In its 2015 ruling, Berlin?s regional court ruled in favour of the mother, arguing that the contents of the daughter?s Facebook account should be owned by her heirs. The judge insisted then that Facebook chats should be regarded no differently to the girl?s letters and diaries which her parents automatically inherited. Facebook appealed against that ruling, which is why the case was heard by the court of appeal. The ruling on Wednesday was based on weighing up inheritance laws drawn up almost 120 years ago and the rights of parents towards minors, with the telecommunications secrecy law introduced to protect the privacy of telephone conversations which was updated by the constitutional court in 2009 to include emails. BjÃ¶rn Retzlaff, the judge who ruled in Berlin, deemed that the same rules applied to internet chats. ?That is at the centre of our decision,? Retzlaff told the court, stressing at the same time that the decision had been a difficult one.In a statement in German to the media Facebook said it welcomed the ruling, adding: ?At the same time we are sympathetic towards the family and respect their wish. We are making every effort to find a solution which helps the family at the same time as protecting the privacy of third parties who are also affected by this.?The case recalls that of an Italian architect who appealed to Apple?s chief executive, Tim Cook, last year to unblock his dead 13-year-old son?s iPhone so he could download the photographs stored on it.

"Slain Hizbul commander Sabzar Ahmad Bhat remained in hiding for nearly 10 hours without firing a single bullet at the troops during the encounter, Army sources said. Bhat, who succeeded Burhan Wani, also sent text messages from his handset to gather a crowd of stone-pelters at the encounter site to provide him cover, the sources added.","Summarise: Sabzar Ahmad Bhat, the slain Hizbul commander who routinely released his photographs in combat gear for social media, was no braveheart. Details emerging about the terrorist's last moments point at his being more adept at shooting from a smartphone than the Kalashnikov on his shoulder.Senior Army sources, privy to the operation in which Bhat was cornered and neutralised in Tral area of Kashmir's Pulwama district last Saturday, told Mail Today that the 27-year-old terrorist remained in hiding for nearly 10 hours, without firing a single bullet at the troops.Bhat also frantically sent text messages from his handset to gather a crowd of stone-pelters at the encounter site to provide him cover, the sources said.HOW DID ARMY TRACK SABZARSecurity forces had tracked down Bhat's location using technical intelligence provided to the troops on ground by the Jammu and Kashmir police cells. These units have been successful in nailing a large number of terrorists in recent years.""The intelligence provided by the police confirmed that Sabzar and Faizan were in a cluster of houses in Saimoo village in Tral area and we laid a cordon on Friday evening around his house,"" senior Army sources said. The raiding party included Army, Special Operations Groups and state police troops.After laying the cordon, the troops tried to establish contact with Sabzar and his category A accomplice Faizan. There was no retaliation or firing from the terrorists in hiding as forces suspect the two did not want to give away their positions.A large number of weapons including an AK-47 and INSAS assault rifles along with a huge cache of ammunition and other warlike stores, were recovered from the hideout after the operation was over.After failing to establish contact with terrorists, the raiding team decided to ""smoke out the rats"" and called for fire tenders filled with petrol instead of water.STONE PELTERS TO RESCUE?Meanwhile, Bhat and his accomplice were trying to gather a crowd of stonepelters to be able to escape from the encounter location but the late hours did not get them much help. Sources said their messages betrayed desperation and fear.""Petrol was poured inside the first house using hose pipes and it was set on fire but the two did not react. The result in the second house was also the same. But when the troops poured in petrol in the third house around 8:15 am, the two ran out of the house and tried to breach the cordon,"" the sources said. Before Bhat could open fire, the troops fired a hail of bullets. Within a few seconds, the two ""propagandist terrorists"" were lying dead on the ground.Army sources said Sabzar, a Class 7 dropout, was a known womaniser and drug addict at the time of his joining the Hizbul Mujahidden two years back. He replaced Burhan Wani who had been killed last year by the Army in South Kashmir.Both the terrorists were tracked by technical intelligence sleuths and killed in similar brief encounters. Sources said in Burhan's case too, the terrorist was trapped when the technical cells of Jammu and Kashmir police had followed a terrorist named Sartaj and did not know about Burhan's presence there.However, in Sabzar's case, they were tracking him directly and were sure about his presence in the Tral area.Sources said the recent crop of local terrorists is high on propaganda and try to conjure up a hero-like status by spreading their pictures on social media in full combat gear. ""Little do they know that this act of theirs is of big help for security forces in identifying them and locating them,"" the sources said.As part of Pakistan's strategy, local terrorists, who are not even trained formally into firing and combat tactics, are being used as cannon fodder to keep the militancy in J&K alive.Also Read"

"After being denied visa twice, an all-female robotics team from Afghanistan has been granted a special one-time temporary US visa over humanitarian reasons after President Donald Trump intervened. This allows the team to participate in an international robotics competition. The US embassy in Kabul did not disclose why it rejected the team's visas earlier.","Summarise: Six Afghan teenage girls are to compete in person in a global robotics competition in Washington on Sunday after the US reversed a decision not to grant them visas.The initial rejection of the team?s visa sparked international outcry and the girls became national celebrities in Afghanistan, where many are perplexed about the repercussions of new US immigration rules and feel abandoned by their American allies.A US state department official confirmed to the Guardian that there were new developments under way in the girls? case. The team said they had been asked to go to the embassy in Kabul on Thursday. ?We are so happy I can?t find words for it,? Rodaba Noori, 15, said from the runway as the girls were about to board a plane from their home city, Herat, to the Afghan capital.?We will stay in the United States for about seven days. We will compare the cultures between the US and Afghanistan, and go sightseeing and talk to the people,? she said, in English. In an interview before the reversal, the girls had expressed their shock at the rejection. ?We thought the US and Afghanistan had friendly relations. We thought the US?s fight for women?s rights and equality would get us visas,? Noori said.Yet since it took international outrage to sway the US visa decision, the U-turn will not assuage confusion in Afghanistan over Washington?s future commitments. Human Rights Watch called the visa denial ?all too emblematic of the hollowness of US efforts to empower girls in Afghanistan?.Successive American governments have heralded women?s rights as a key reason for US forces? continued stay in Afghanistan, and a cornerstone of US aid to the country is the five-year Promote programme, which states: ?Everyone who cares about the future of Afghanistan supports women?s empowerment as the foundation for economic growth, peace and security.?Only teams from Afghanistan and the Gambia were denied visas for the competition, neither of which is among the six Muslim-majority countries subjected to Donald Trump?s travel ban.Afghans often struggle to get US visas. In May, only 112 Afghan applicants received the B1/B2 visa to the US that the girls applied for. In the same period the US granted the same visa to 1,091 applicants from Iran and 274 from Sudan, which are now subject to Trump?s travel ban after the US supreme court partially reinstated it.When told that a team from Iran had received visas, the girls could not contain their laughter. ?Why is it only Afghans who can?t go? It?s discrimination. It really makes me angry,? said Lida Azizi, 16.The US embassy in Kabul did not disclose why it rejected the robotics competition team. However, given the process, the most likely cause was a suspicion that the girls intended to migrate.Asked whether they would return to Afghanistan after their US trip, the girls ? aged 14 to 16 ? seemed baffled. ?Of course we will. We have our studies, our families, our classmates, our entire lives here,? said Azizi. ?We don?t have any relatives in the US. We only want to go for the competition.?If they make it on time, the girls will watch their ball-sorting robot compete against teams from 156 other countries in the First Global Challenge.From the beginning, the Afghan girls were at a disadvantage. In the male-dominated field of technology, the team?s sponsor wanted an all-female team to represent Afghanistan. But only six of the top 15 girls who emerged got permission from their families to compete.The next hurdle was Afghan customs which, apparently confused by the package sent by the organisers, held the equipment for three and a half months, leaving the girls with only two weeks to build the robot. ?The organisers said, ?you can?t do this?,? said Alireza Mehraban, the team?s mentor. To finish on time, the girls worked over the fasting month of Ramadan. ?We were tired but we came here, even during Eid,? said Kawsar Roshan. She said the team wanted to show the world how far Afghan girls had come during a western intervention that began before most of them were born.?Since I was a child, I wanted to show that girls can do anything, also outside the home,? Kawsar said.To apply for visas, the team twice travelled to Kabul, despite a recent spike in violence in the capital.Two days before their second embassy appointment, a truck bomb killed 150 people in Kabul?s diplomatic quarter. The day they arrived, anti-government protests had the city in lockdown. The girls had to walk to the US embassy, where they received their rejection.?They cried for six hours,? said Mehraban, the mentor. Fatemah Qaderyan said she cried so much she couldn?t leave her relatives? house in Kabul and missed her return flight.For Roya Mahboob, the chief executive of the Digital Citizen Fund, which sponsors the team, allowing the girls to compete sends an important signal. ?The feeling to not be ignored or be equal as boys if the opportunity is available to you is important,? she said."

"Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday claimed that he knew about Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's plans to leave the Congress-RJD-JD(U) alliance and form a new government with BJP for the past three or four months. Adding that people go to any extent for power, he said there was no rule or credibility in Indian politics.","Summarise: Hitting out at Nitish Kumar for joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said that he knew that such a plan was in the making for the last three-four months.""We knew that this (Nitish joining hands with BJP) was being planned for the last three-four months. A person can go to any limits for his own benefit,"" Rahul Gandhi said. The Congress leader said that Nitish Kumar was given the mandate for his fight against anti-communal forces but now he has joined hands with the same forces. The big question, however, is that if Rahul Gandhi knew that Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) was in talks with the BJP to look at the possibility of rebuilding the alliance, did he do anything to put a stop to such plans. RAHUL DID NOT ACT, SAYS NITISHAfter tendering his resignation as Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar said that in the current circumstances, where deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav was accused of corruption, he was finding it difficult to continue ""to be in power"".Nitish Kumar, in an attack on Rahul Gandhi, said that while the Congress vice-president tore the ordinance exempting politicians from facing corruption charges, he did not do anything to save the Grand Alliance. A few days ago, Nitish Kumar had met Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi where the two reportedly talked about the corruption charges against Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad and his family members, including son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav.At the meeting, Nitish Kumar was believed to have conveyed to Rahul Gandhi that under present circumstances Tejashwi Yadav could not continue in his Cabinet.Given Congress' long association with RJD, many would argue that the former could have convinced Lalu Prasad to ask his son to quit the Cabinet for the time-being. SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED IN GOA TOOThis, however, is not the first time when Rahul Gandhi and the Congress leadership were found to be on the back foot despite having prior knowledge about the situation threatening to go out of their hands.In the recent Assembly election in Goa, the Congress had more seats than the BJP but lost the chance of forming the government due to alleged delay in decision-making by the leadership. As an active BJP reached out to everyone it could to get the numbers on its side, sources in the Congress said that the leadership, in particular Digvijaya Singh, was late in deciding on the leader of the legislature party. Disgruntled Congress MLA Vishwajit Rane put in his papers and joined the BJP, blaming the leadership for delay in decision-making. Â ""We waited from 11 am to 5 pm not knowing anything about what is happening but BJP swiftly acted,"" said Congress MLA Jennifer Monserrate.Rahul Gandhi, while crying foul over BJP forming the governments in Goa and Manipur where Congress had more seats, accused the BJP of stealing the mandate by using ""financial power"".ALSO READ:Why Nitish Kumar has almost killed Opposition chances to challenge Modi with a Grand Alliance in 2019 "
"Writing about Indian skipper Virat Kohli's performance in an article, Sourav Ganguly stated, ""Against Australia, probably he (Kohli) was so consumed by wanting to win as captain that he let his emotions affect his batting."" This will also serve as a lesson for Virat... I hope he cools down and gets back to scoring big again,"" Ganguly added.","Summarise: Virat Kohli's batting was affected by his emotional outbursts in the acrimonious Test series against Australia, feels former captain Sourav Ganguly, who is hoping that the Indian skipper ""cools down"" to score big again.Ganguly observed that Kohli's desire to win at any cost as a captain led to his outbursts. (Kohli's friendship comment made in heat of moment: Warne)""Against Australia, probably he (Kohli) was so consumed by wanting to win as captain that he let his emotions affect his batting. This will also serve as a lesson for Virat. He's such a precocious talent, I hope he cools down and gets back to scoring big again,"" Ganguly wrote in a for the 'ICC' website.India got the better of Australia 2-1 at home in one of the most intense and bitterly-fought series in recent years. The contest was marred by one controversy after another with the two captains -- Kohli and Steve Smith -- continuously being in the eye of a storm.Kohli was in sublime form before this series, becoming the only man to slam double hundreds in four consecutive series. The 28-year-old amassed 1457 runs in 13 matches this season. But he had a horrendous outing with the bat in the series against Tests against Australia, totalling just 46 runs in five innings with scores of 0, 13, 12, 15 and 6 in three games. He had to sit out of the fourth and final Test because of a shoulder injury. Ganguly, regarded as one of India's most successful captains, rated Kohli as among of the finest in the world while describing him as a passionate skipper.""There are two Virats for me. The batsman and the captain. (Kohli has ensured India will never back down: Clarke to India Today)""The batsman surely is one of the best in the world because he has set high standards for himself, both in terms of fitness and the hunger to score big. The captain is more passionate and more of a leader than anything else,"" Ganguly wrote.""He wants to win and win every day and while it may not be possible always, I see Virat not settling for anything that isn't No.1.""GANGULY PRAISES PUJARAThe former India skipper also shared his delight at watching KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav gain in confidence and match Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin. He tipped Cheteshwar Pujara as the batsman who will be most critical to India's successes abroad.""More than the results, I enjoyed the journey, watching how players like KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav gained in confidence and matched the two champions, Virat and Ravichandran Ashwin,"" Ganguly wrote.  (Sachin Tendulkar calls Cheteshwar Pujara 'silent warrior')""But the one who stood out was Cheteshwar Pujara. I remember when he was dropped for a Test in West Indies last year, I had said Pujara was a special batsman and shouldn't have been dropped. A small matter of 1,316 runs have come from his bat this season and Pujara will be the most critical for Virat when India start travelling outside of the sub-continent.""'POTENTIAL TO WIN ANYWHERE'Ganguly said the current Indian team has the potential to win anywhere in the world.""And having watched the last 13 home Tests, I hope Virat and his team really has the potential to win anywhere - in or outside India,"" he said.Talking about the Dharamsala Test, which according to him was the highlight of the season, Ganguly wrote: ""I was sitting at home around lunchtime on Day Three when Australia began its second innings. (Virat Kohli needs to take short break from cricket: Brad Haddin )""Over the next hour or so, I watched such a great piece of fast and hostile bowling by the two Indians, Umesh Yadav and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The way they got the Australians hopping and succumbing to the pace, I am so pleased for Virat.""The most memorable win came in conditions actually tailor-made for the Australians more than the Indians. The fact that India beat the Aussies at their own game will surely give another twist to Virat's captaincy.""'KUMBLE'S ROLE'Ganguly also said chief coach Anil Kumble played a big role in India's success in the home season.""When the BCCI appointed a three-member panel that had Tendulkar, Laxman and me to help in the process of selecting a coach, Anil's vision was as decisive as his bowling used to be. He wanted India to win in India obviously, but outside of India too and while he knew it was easier said than done, his assessment of the situation was superb,"" he wrote. "

We are businesses with bottom lines and budgets...[I]t's a balance of commerce and art, and both matter,"" he added. Karan further said he also launched Sidharth Malhotra, who has no lineage in Bollywood.","Summarise: Karan Johar is fed up with the allegations of nepotism. It all began on his talk show Koffee With Karan where Kangana Ranaut called him the ""flag-bearer of nepotism"". This opened the floodgates to endless debates about the ethics behind casting star-kids in films at the cost of denying chances to deserving industry outsiders.Now, Karan Johar has opened his heart on the matter in his latest blog post. Starting off by saying that he cannot handle the 'nepospasms' (A condition that, KJo describes, arises from the fear of the word 'nepotism'), Karan Johar goes on to defend his casting choices and adds that if he can be accused of nepotism, everyone can be.""While we're on the subject, may I point out that while we can (and have) put the star on screen, we cannot make the audience arrive. So if it is a nepotistic world, we're not the only ones guilty of it. Taken a look at any entertainment website recently? They're full of star kids.

They step out and they're photographed, they're the ultimate clickbait,"" Karan Johar wrote on Ndtv.com.Karan Johar added that his nepotism was a ""a result of easy access to an exceptional resource.""""Yes, I have launched Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan, and, yes, maybe you can say nepotism played a part. You can argue that there was proximity and I leveraged it, that there were relationships at play which were factored. David Dhawan was, and is, a friend. I took his son on as an AD (assistant director) as a favour to that friend. And then I saw talent. And then I platformed it. When it came to Alia, I wasn't even talking to Mahesh Bhatt! I've even gone on record saying we had issues. We had auditioned 5,000 people and she was one of them. If there was anyone better than Alia Bhatt, she would have been in the movie, but there wasn't. She just stood out. Maybe her name played a role in why, but I think her body of work already proves that's not it,"" Karan Johar wrote.Karan Johar went on to defend his right to cast whoever he wants provided his casting decision brings audience in the theatres.""We're not NGOs! We are businesses with bottom lines and budgets. And tomorrow if I want to launch Shah Rukh Khan's son because he's Shah Rukh Khan's son and I believe I can gain from it, why won't I?

He reached the Crime Branch Inter State Cell office in Chanakyapuri at 5 PM. He was arrested after being questioned for close to six hours, Praveer Ranjan, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), said. Dinakaran has been interrogated for a total of 37 hours, and will be produced at Tiz Hazari Court this afternoon after a medical test at Safdarjung Hospital.Â  DINAKARAN ADMITS HE MET SUKESH Dinakaran has admitted to meeting Sukesh Chandrasekhar, under the impression that he was a high court judge, police said on Monday. At the same time, he denied having paid any money to SukeshÂ  in an attempt to obtain the AIADMK's symbol for his camp, police said. Until Monday, Dinakaran had maintained that he didn't know Sukesh, and that he hadn't met him.Â  Police have also questioned Dinakaran's personal assistant Janardhana in connection with the case.Â  Sources said he has agreed to be a witness. WHY WAS MALLIKARJUNA ARRESTED? Mallikarjuna was arrested for allegedly facilitating the deal between Dinakaran and Sukesh Chandrasekar, Praveer Ranjan said.Mallikarjuna had been accompanying Dinakaran everywhere ever since Sukesh was arrested on April 16 for allegedly striking a deal of Rs 50 crore to help the AIADMK (Amma) faction keep the poll symbol.Dinakaran, Mallikarjuna and Chandrasekar will be questioned together to establish the money trail, details of the deal and whether more people were involved in it.Â  CHANDRASEKAR'S CUSTODY EXTENDED On Tuesday, the police produced Chandrasekar before a special court, which extended his custody till April 28.

However, a powerful section of the AIADMK Amma recently revolted against the Sasikala-Dinakaran leadership.That happened after Panneerselvam demanded the ouster of Sasikala and Dinakaran as a condition for the merger.Dinakaran later announced he would stay away from party affairs, and that he could be removed only by Sasikala.Sasikala is currently serving a four-year jail term in Bengaluru in a disproportionate assets case.(Inputs from PTI) ALSO READ | TTV Dinakaran confesses to meeting middleman in EC bribery case, assumed he was high court judge"

"Eye surgeon MC Modi in 1968 carried out 833 cataract operations in 14 hours in Tirupati. He is also known to have been recognised by the Guinness World Records for performing the highest number of eye surgeries in a day. During his lifetime, he reportedly performed about 7 lakh eye surgeries, all of which were free.","Summarise: What Mother Teresa is to Calcutta's dying destitutes, Dr Murugappa Chennaveerappa Modi, 72. is to the poor blind villagers of Karnataka. For 45 years. Modi, the internationally recognised eye surgeon, has been waging a one-man war against blindness. In 1986, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records for performing 833 eye operations in a day, the highest in the world. The operations were conducted in Tirupati in 1968 over 14 continuous hours. Modi. Kannukota anna (the brother who gives vision) to the local people, has performed as many as 5.79 lakh eye operations so far. And his labour has always been free.For Modi, his mission is spiritual. ""I see myself as a poojary. The patient is my god, every village is my place of pilgrimage, the operating table is my shrine and my instruments are the accessories of worship,"" says the sprightly surgeon who lives a spartan existence. Born of humble parentage - a Kannadiga from Bijapur district - Modi threw away a lucrative career in private practice after attending Gandhiji's historic prayer meeting at Bombay on August 8, 1942 where the Quit India resolution was passed. That meeting changed his life. And Modi, the gifted ophthalmologist, dedicated his life to the sightless.""I felt affected when I saw blind people begging. They just did not have money to go to doctors."" Modi recalled.And those who had the money had often sold their jewellery or livestock to put it together for the treatment. This tragic fact of rural India spurred Modi to pioneer the concept of mass eye camps.In an assembly line fashion, Modi operates 40 patients an hour, attending to four patients at a time. Ambidextrous, he performs delicate eye surgeries with his left hand. He does cataract operations, squint corrections and cornea transplants. Earlier, Modi used to perform 600 to 700 operations a day in his camps. But now in Karnataka, he operates on 200 to 300 patients every day.His phenomenal contributions for the sightless have not gone unappreciated. Recognition has come to him through the Padma Shree and Padma Bhushan. Hellen Keller, the blind and deaf-mute American author, who attended one of his camps in 1954 asked Modi: ""Have you insured your hands?"" In his mass eye camps, apart from the 5.79 lakh operations, he has examined 50 lakh patients and given free food to over 100 lakh persons.Initially Modi had a hard time communicating his mission to the people. ""Villagers used to ask me if I was that good, why was I operating for tree? Modi reminisced. "

"The members of the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union in Maharashtra on Monday said to the Supreme Court that the prevailing ban-like atmosphere in the state could push bar dancers into activities like prostitution. The union further reminded the court that the closing down of the bars in 2005 had left over 75,000 female workers unemployed.","Summarise: Maharashtra's bar dancers have waltzed up to the Supreme Court and argued that the prevailing ban-like atmosphere in the state could push them into activities like prostitution.Members of the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union knocked on the SC's door on Monday against the ""unjust and arbitrary"" new restrictions such as curbs on body movement, ban on acceptance of tips and showering of money as well as serving of liquor in performing area apart from mandatory installation of CCTV cameras.They reminded the court that the closing down of the bars in 2005 left over 75,000 female workers unemployed. They brought to the apex court's attention the observation of another bench that struck down a similar state law. The plea will be heard on March 2. The Maharashtra government had over a decade ago suspended the licences of bars and hotels where young women were employed to dance to racy film songs for male customers, claiming they were a bad influence on society.But the top court said last year that bars could once again apply for licences.SUPREME COURT'S JUDGMENTThe SC had in an earlier judgment said, ""It has been brought on the record that many of them (bar dancers) have been compelled to take up prostitution out of necessity for maintenance of their families. In our opinion, the impugned legislation has proved to be totally counterproductive and cannot be sustained.""This is the first time that bar dancers themselves have come forward to oppose the Maharashtra law.Till now the challenge was only from hotel, restaurant and dance bar owners. The fresh plea has termed the new Act as ""arbitrary"" and ""violative"" of their right to earn a livelihood through legitimate means. The union alleges that the term ""obscene dance"" in the Act has been deliberately kept vague to allow police to harass performers.The SC had earlier slammed the Maharashtra Police on the matter. The apex court summoned and reminded the Mumbai DCP (licensing) that it was better for women to perform in dance bars than indulge in ""unacceptable activities"".""You have to change your mindset,"" Justice Dipak Misra had said.

"Jude Sparks, a 10-year-old kid, accidentally discovered a rare 1.2 million-year-old skull of a stegomastodon, a prehistoric ancestor of elephants, while hiking in the Las Cruces desert in New Mexico, US. ""This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico"", said a University professor who is currently studying the fossil, which weighs about a tonne.","Summarise: A 10-year boy has accidentally discovered a rare, mostly intact 1.2 million year-old skull of stegomastodon - a prehistoric ancestor of elephants - while hiking in the Las Cruces desert in the US.?I was running farther up and I tripped on part of the tusk,? said Jude Sparks, who had been hiking in the desert with his parents.?My face landed next to the bottom jaw. I looked farther up and there was another tusk,? said Sparks.The Sparks family contacted Peter Houde, a professor at the New Mexico State University (NMSU) in the US.?A stegomastodon would look to any of us like an elephant,? said Houde.?For the several types of elephants that we have in the area, this is probably one of the more common of them. But they?re still very rare. This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico,? he said.After the family contacted Houde, the jaw and two pieces of tusk were taken to the Vertebrate Museum at NMSU.In May, the family joined a team of scientists who worked for about a week to carefully unearth the skull.Houde estimates the jaw weighs about 120 pounds and the entire skull as little as a tonne. While the skull may appear to be strong, it is quite delicate.?The upper part of the skull is deceiving. It?s mostly hollow and the surface of the skull is eggshell thin,? Houde said.?An extremely large skull would be very heavy for the animal if it didn?t have air inside it to lighten it up just like our own sinuses,? he said.?That makes the thing extremely fragile and the only thing holding it together is the sediment surrounding it,? he added.During the weeklong extraction process, 10 to 12 people helped at different times with the excavation of the stegomastodon skull.Researchers painstakingly brushed away the last bits of dirt from the skull and tusk and applied chemical hardeners to ensure the ancient bones remained intact.Acting like plastics, the chemicals harden and restore the strength that would otherwise be present in the bone as protein.After the skull was unearthed, the team carefully coated the fossil with plaster and placed wood braces to protect and support it.The skull was lifted from the dig site by a front-end loader and placed on a flatbed truck for the trip back to the university.While the process to study and reconstruct the skull, jaw and tusks will take years to complete, Houde said that the stegomastodon fossil will eventually go on display.

"The Vatican has turned off 100 fountains for the first time in years due to a prolonged drought affecting the city state and surrounding Italian city Rome. The Vatican said this was its ""way of living in solidarity with Rome."" Rome, which has also closed drinking fountains, is considering water rationing for as many as eight hours a day. ","Summarise: Vatican authorities have turned off 100 fountains, including two Baroque masterpieces in St. Peter?s Square, due to a prolonged drought affecting the tiny city state and the city of Rome, which surrounds it. Suffocating summer heat has followed two years of lower-than-average rainfall in Rome, forcing the Italian capital to close drinking fountains and consider the prospect of water rationing.More than a million residents of Rome are facing water rationing for up to eight hours a day as the prolonged heatwave that has ravaged southern Europe takes its toll. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said it was the first time authorities in the spiritual home of the world?s 1.2 billion Catholics could remember being forced to turn off the fountains. Standing in St Peter?s Square, where two fountains by 17th-century sculptors Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini stood dry, Burke said the Vatican wanted to help. ?This is the Vatican?s way of living in solidarity with Rome, trying to help Rome get through this crisis,? he told Reuters TV.The measure was initiated on Monday, and all 100 Vatican fountains will be turned off gradually over the coming days. Rome is gasping after 72% less rain than normal fell in July, according to Sky Italia?s weather TV channel. There was 74% less than normal in June, and a 56% reduction from the long-term average across March, April and May. Caring for the planet and its resources is an important issue for Pope Francis, who demanded swift action by world leaders in the first ever papal document dedicated to the environment. ?This decision is very much in line with the pope?s thinking on ecology: you can?t waste and sometimes you have to be willing to make a sacrifice,? Burke said. "

"Shiv Sena's tally in recently concluded BMC election rose to 87 on Friday as three independent councillors, who had earlier parted ways with the party, returned to its fold. However, Sena is still short of 27 councillors to touch the halfway mark of 114 seats. This came amid reports that Sena has approached Congress for a post-poll alliance.","Summarise: A day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls threw up a hung verdict, Shiv Sena's tally of corporators rose to 87 today with three party rebels who won as Independent nominees returning to its fold. This gave a slight push to Uddhav Thackeray's efforts to cobble up numbers but reaching the magic figure of 114 seats needed to rule the cash-rich civic body is still a far cry. The development came at a time when both the Sena and its estranged ally BJP which has won 82 seats, are keeping cards close to their chest on the prospects of coming together again to attain power or otherwise. While Snehal More (Vikhroli) and Tulsiram Shinde (Dindoshi) arrived at Matoshree, the Bandra residence of Thackeray, in morning where they were reinducted, Changez Multani (Andheri) extended his support in evening.

It contested the BMC polls separately by dumping the BJP. Sena is a junior partner of the BJP in Centre and Maharashtra government. However, the resurgent BJP breached the Sena citadel of Mumbai and bagged 82 seats, just two less than Sena's Friday tally of 84.

The merger talks had been revealed by the Indian steel giant last year as part of a major restructuring of its UK steel business. Such a deal with the German steel major could potentially lead to the formation of a European steel behemoth with blast furnaces in Wales, the Netherlands and Germany. However, The Sunday Times claims that the deal may be under threat due to German pension liabilities. The deal has been slow moving as Tata Steel tries to solve the problem of its own 15-billion-pound British steel pensions scheme. Last month its UK workers had voted in favour of a new pension deal to save their jobs. Nearly 10,000 workers voted in a ballot in favour of moving from a final salary pension to a less generous scheme in return for job safety andÂ Tatas promise of nearly 1-billion-pound worth of investment over the next 10 years. According to the newspaper, Dutch unions representing workers at Tatas vast Ijmuiden plant have raised concerns over the Thyssenkrupp pensions, which are an unfunded liability and underpinned by cash-flow from the steelworks. Thyssenkrupp is under pressure from the activist investor Cevian and recently sold its steel venture in Brazil for 1.3 billion euros. "

"Charles Rolls, the Co-founder of upmarket tonic water maker Fever-Tree, sold a stake of around 4% in the company for Â£73 million (around ?602 crore). Rolls cashed in the shares that have risen over 50% this year alone and are currently up 924% since its IPO in late 2014. After the sale, Rolls still owns around 11.2% of the company.","Summarise: Fever-Tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder Charles Rolls cashed in Â£73m of shares.The sale left the company?s stock down 2% at Â£17.12 on Thursday ? but that is still nearly 13 times its Â£1.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago.Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m.He retains an 11.2% holding worth Â£222m, and the company is valued at nearly Â£2bn.That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Domino?s Pizza, and about three times as much as the Debenhams store chain.That is astonishing for a business with sales of just Â£100m and only 46 full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin. But it is testament to the super-speed growth the company has delivered since Rolls and co-founder Tim Warrillow launched it in 2005.From a standing start, the duo became millionaires within a decade, selling Â£25m of stock between them when they floated the company on the AIM market in 2014. Rolls has cashed out to the tune of Â£100m, because he also sold a Â£12m tranche of shares last year.He owes not just his fortune but apparently his life to tonic water ? or at least to its key medicinal ingredient, quinine. He once contracted malaria during a trip to Africa and has credited the chemical, obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree referenced in the company?s name, with saving his life.Though the company started out with tonic water, it has expanded to include variants on the drink, as well as Sicilian lemonade and ginger ale.It has managed to stand out from the crowd by consciously embracing luxury status, making much of the exotic origin of its ingredients and the great expense of getting them into your glass.Its ginger comes from Ivory Coast and Nigeria, its lemons from Sicily, and Warrillow once braved checkpoints manned by militiamen to source quinine from a remote part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.These are the credentials that have ensured no luxury hotel or Michelin-starred restaurant is without a supply of Fever-Tree in its mixer cabinet.Indeed, one of the company?s early customers was world-renowned chef Ferran AdriÃ , who made its tonic a firm fixture in his restaurant El Bulli, rated by many gastronomes as the world?s best and quirkiest restaurant before it served up its last liquid olive in 2011.Posh tonic has also benefited from a serendipitous resurgence in gin, increasingly seen as a sophisticated spirit worth splashing out on.Gin menus are a common feature of bars in countries where the spirit is particularly popular such as the UK, Spain and US. And premium gins demand to be mixed with premium tonics.Fever-Tree has ridden the crest of this alcoholic wave like no other company, reporting pre-tax profits last year that more than doubled to Â£34.3m on sales of Â£102m.This month, the company announced that its 2017 results would comfortably exceed City forecasts, indicating that the Fever-Tree star is still very much in the ascendancy.Rolls, a former management consultant who revived the Plymouth Gin brand, and Warrilow, a former ad man, teamed up in an attempt to challenge the domination by Schweppes of the mixers market.Rolls had noticed that the world?s finest gins were mixed with the same mass-produced tonic. ?There?s no point having a good gin if the tonic isn?t right,? he said, pointing out that tonic makes up the lion?s share of a G&T, at least if it is made right.This year, Rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position.That might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business.And with an extra Â£73m in the bank, Rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first G&T of the day."

"RSS ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said Muslims in India have realised that even Allah doesn't want an ""impure"" mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.

The only difference being that one is abstract and the other takes the form of Lord Ram,"" he added.According to Kumar, the minority community in India now realises that those who are trying to encroach the land forcefully were neither following the principles of Quran nor the Prophet, but were only interested in continuing the stalemate.""They believe that Ram is like their Nabi or Paigambar and most definitely that of their ancestors, thus they want a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to end the dispute forever. They have understood that even though they may be Muslims by faith but in Hindustan their ancestors were all Hindus and their social and domestic customs too were that of the Hindus,"" Kumar said.Also read:Babri Masjid demolition: Supreme Court restores conspiracy charges against LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti"

The News Corp-backed portal, which recently merged Housing.com with itself, tracks primary residential markets of nine cities -- Gurgaon, Noida, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata and Ahmedabad. ""Before demonetisation, the monthly average residential sales and launches during July-October months were at around 19,000 units and 18,000 units, respectively, which were affected drastically on account of currency demonetisation.

A group of six men posing as Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers stole jewellery worth ?20 lakh from a jeweller's house in Delhi's Karol Bagh area. The thieves entered the residence on the pretext of a CBI raid and held the jeweller's four-year-old grandson at gun-point as they ransacked the house.  ,"Summarise: It started like any other day at jeweller Nawal Kishore Khandelwal?s home in central Delhi?s Karol Bagh; he and his two sons left for their shop in Chandni Chowk, the women worked through morning chores and as they settled in for the afternoon, a man in khaki and five masked men rang the bell. ?My wife opened the door and the man identified himself as a CBI official. Five more men who were with him told her that they had come to raid the house. Before my wife could understand anything, the men pushed her inside,? said Khandelwal.For the next 10 minutes ? shortly after 1.30pm ? the suspects held a gun to Khandelawal?s four-year-old grandson Divyansh as they rummaged through the house before escaping with gold and diamond jewellery worth around Rs 20 lakh. The police said the incident, which took place on Wednesday, was the first time robbers had posed as police officers to carry out an armed robbery in a home in the middle of the day.Mandeep Singh Randhawa, the deputy commissioner of police (central), said a case of robbery and theft has been registered but the suspects are yet to be identified. ?One of them put a pistol to Divyansh?s head and threatened to kill him if anybody screamed for help or raised an alarm,? said the 61-year-old jewellery Besides Khandelwal?s wife Urmila and the child, the robbers held his daughter-in-law Megha hostage. One of the men took the keys to a locker from Megha and he ransacked the locker. The hold-up would have likely lasted longer had Khandelwal?s other daughter-in-law, Preeti, not spotted it and raised an alarm. Her scream?s led the men to flee, Khandlewal said, adding that they did not touch the cash and other jewellery in the house. The attack had left Urmila, 58, with a fracture in the left shoulder and Megha with a broken right foot.Three teams have been formed to investigate the case. The teams are collecting details about criminals who operate using similar methods, and are poring over electronic surveillance and human intelligence networks. The data of mobile phones active in the area during the crime are also being analysed for clues. "

I am not a fan. In Meri Pyaari Bindu, I'm a Hindi writer. There are some raunchy titles like Awara Dhoban and Chudail ki Choli. I imagine Bindu in every character. The film thrives on nostalgia, and nostalgia never gets dated right? Yes. It just gets better. But this is not all about the past. It's a life journey of these characters from 5 to 35. It is also set in current time.Bindu and Abhimanyu make a mix-tape. Have you made a mix-tape for somebody?Of course. For myself and my first girlfriend who went on to become my wife. I made her a 90-minute Hindi English mix. There was no graph. It was random. There was a Kishore Kumar ""Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas"" and then suddenly Bryan Adams' ""Best of Me"".Your brother Aparshakti Khurana has also taken to films. Is there a rivalry now?There could be no rivalry because there is so much of love. I am a protective brother. He respects me a lot. Though there is a difference of three years, he touches my feet. He does it in front of everybody deliberately. And I'm like Ghar pe kar le, but he will do it even at award shows. He has been doing so since childhood so he suddenly won't change his ways.Â We look similar but we are so different. I was a co-curricular captain of the school. He was the captain of the sports team. He has captained the Haryana under-19 cricket team. He is one of thode rare Punjabis who can speak fluent Haryanvi too which is why he fit so well in Dangal too. Your career graph is defined by playing the loveable fool in romantic comedies such as Vicky Donor, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Meri Pyaari Bindu. But you are now turning things around by working with Sriram Raghavan. Tell us about it.I think you need time for everything. You have to establish yourself as a guy next door, and then do something radical later. If you try something radical with every film, then you will get exhausted.Â  You are limited some way or the other even if you are multi-talented. Though a lot of thrillers were being offered to me, I wanted a Sriram Raghavan thriller. He is the master of thrillers. This is the perfect time for that metamorphosis. This is the most challenging role of my life.And you are working with Tabu.Oh My God, she is stunning. My father and I both have a crush on her. I start shooting it in June. Â  Then there's Shubh Mangal Savdhan, a remake of a Tamil film, with Bhumi Pednekar.It is the antithesis of Vicky Donor. I play a guy who has erectile dysfunction. The filmmaker, RS Prasanna, calls it a spiritual remake of the original. It came out in 2012 andÂ  was seen as the Vicky Donor of south even though the topics are different. Shubh Mangal Savdhan is radical, quirky and a family film despite the topic.Are you happy with the movie offers coming your way?I am fortunate that I have been a part of two National Award-winning films in five years. I am getting good choices being part of boutique management of Yash Raj where they handle a fixed number of actors. I am pretty content. Would you want to try action, a genre that heroes want to have in their filmography?I started with an unconventional film and I am unconventional in a way. I want to just own that space. I want to be myself. If everybody aspires to be a conventional, commercial hero, who will become the Amol Palekar and Farooq Sheikh of this generation? "

"A British teenage girl who allegedly married an Islamic State militant over Skype has been accused of plotting a terror attack in the UK, reports said. Indoctrinated by extremist ideology, the girl reportedly tried to get a gun and grenade. The teenager is accused of received instructions on how to use the weapons allegedly between December 2016 and April 2017.","Summarise: A teenage girl is alleged to have married an Islamic State fighter in Syria via Skype and became so indoctrinated that she tried to get a gun and grenade to stage a terrorist attack against Britain. The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday charged with the alleged plot.She is believed to be from a Moroccan background and was aged 16 when she met the alleged Isis terrorist, who originally comes from Coventry, online. He is now believed to be dead, killed in a drone strike in April.The teenager, from London, is accused of receiving instructions on how to use the weapons and asking for help in carrying out the plot. The case is said to have involved explicit foreign direction, and the plotting is alleged to have happened between 1 December 2016 and 12 April 2017.The accused was aged just 16 when she ?married? the Isis fighter via Skype, in an online ceremony. There is considerable doubt that it would be considered valid under either Islamic or British laws. The man is understood to have used the internet and social media including Skype, an online voice and video communications programme.During Wednesday?s short court hearing, her lawyer, Vajahat Sharif, said that the girl would plead not guilty. In court, the teenager, wearing a Nike tracksuit and with her long black hair tied in a ponytail, spoke only to confirm her name and age.District judge Tan Ikram remanded her in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 11 August. She will also appear there on the same date in relation to another terror offence for which she had previously been charged.In a statement the Metropolitan police said the teenager had been charged with having ?the intention of committing acts of terrorism engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect the that intention?.The elements of the offence, the Met said, were: ?i. Communicating with a Daesh [Isis] fighter in Syria and arranging to receive weapons in order to conduct an attack in the UK; ii. Receiving instructions on how train and use weapons; iii. Reaching out to another to receive assistance in completing plan.?Last week, Met commissioner Cressida Dick said: ?Six attack planning plots were thwarted in the last four months alone, and we can expect that figure to rise.?Britain?s top police officer added: ?The bulk of this domestic threat seems to be from those who are inspired by overseas networks, though there have undoubtedly been some who have been more directly enabled by them also, and we should not assume that attempts by senior leaderships of overseas groups to direct more or less sophisticated UK attacks have gone away.?The terrorist threat level from Islamist inspired terrorism in Britain remains at severe, meaning that an attack is considered highly likely. Three such attacks have claimed lives in Britain since 22 March."

"Scientists have developed a lightweight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements. The inner surfaces are coated with gold and a carbon polymer film, comprising the electric nanogenerator. Pressing and releasing the device for a few minutes charged the device to 1 volt, which was enough to power a remote control or a watch, researchers said.","Summarise: Washington, Apr 17 (PTI) Inspired by the Chinese and Japanese arts of paper-cutting, scientists have developed a light-weight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements to power sensors and watches. Despite the many advances in portable electronic devices, one thing remains constant - the need to plug them into a wall socket to recharge. Portable electronic devices, such as watches, hearing aids and heart monitors, often require only a little energy. They usually get that power from conventional rechargeable batteries. Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology in the US and Chongqing University in China wanted to see if they could untether small energy needs from the wall socket by harvesting energy from a users body movements. They have been working on this approach in recent years, creating triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that can harness the mechanical energy all around us, such as that created by our footsteps, and then use it to power portable electronics. However, most TENG devices take several hours to charge small electronics, such as a sensor, and they are made of acrylic, which is heavy. Researchers turned to an ultra-light, rhombic paper-cut design a few inches long and covered it with different materials to turn it into a power unit. The four outer sides, made of gold- and graphite-coated sand paper, comprised the devices energy-storing supercapacitor element. "

The farmers reportedly justified their demand by quoting the ?1 crore acquisition rate in Mumbai-Goa highway project and ?52 lakh to ?5.2 crore per hectare rate in Mumbai-Nagpur expressway project.,"Summarise: The proposed West Coast Refinery and Petrochemical project seems to have run into trouble, as farmers in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have asked the state government to hike the land acquisition rate to Rs1crore a hectare ? at par with the Mubmbai-Nagpur super communication highway. The project, which is estimated to cost Rs2.5 lakh crore, needs 6,018 hectares of land from around 3,000 farmers in 16 villages in two districts. The state government in May issued a notification under the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) Act, clarifying its intent to acquire land for the project. The project has been proposed by three government-controlled oil marketing companies with the stakes of the Centre and the state governments. The state has followed the acquisition formula adopted for the Jaitapur nuclear power plant in 2013. Farmers in Jaitapur have opposed the land acquisition rate: Rs 22.50 lakh a hectare. In a meeting with Ravindra Chavan, minister of ports and medical education, a delegation of farmers quoted the rate given to Mumbai-Nagpur and Mumbai-Pune expressways and raised 27 demands, including Rs1crore a hectare. ?The delegation expressed its displeasure over the rate being offered to farmers. The government paid Rs1crore a hectare in the Mumbai-Goa highway road widening project and Rs52 lakh to Rs5.2 crore a hectare for the Mumbai-Nagpur corridor. The next meeting has been convened by industries minister Subhash Desai on July 24,? said an official from MIDC.Shiv Sena alleged that the project would disturb the bio-diversity, increase pollution levels and destroy farmers? livelihood. In a climbdown of sorts, it now says that if farmers are ready to handover their land, it has no objection. ?If our 27 demands are fulfilled, we have no objection to the project,? Rajan Salvi, Shiv Sena MLA from Rajapur, told HT.?I am sure the BJP-led government at the Centre and in the state will fulfil all these demands,? said Pramod Jathar former BJP MLA from Kankavali."

Two fingerprints have been lifted from the spot. ?We came to know about the burglary in the morning. An office staff member came early morning and spotted that the door had been forced open. He immediately informed other party members and police was called,? said Pankaj Singh, an  AAP worker at the office.Singh said a cupboard too had been opened by force  and hard discs of two computers, which had important information, were stolen. There were seven CCTV cameras in the office but the burglars took away the DVRs that contained the footage.?It looks like the burglars were well prepared.

"Canadian PM Justin Trudeau was slammed after he explained why he had fought an indigenous politician in a boxing match in 2012. Trudeau recalled in an interview that he decided to fight politician Patrick Brazeau since it was ""the right story to tell"". ""So 'privileged white guy beats up Indian' was the 'right kind of narrative?' Seriously?"", a user tweeted.","Summarise: In one corner stood Canada?s youngest senator, heavily tattooed and armed with a black belt in karate. In the other stood a lanky Justin Trudeau, the underdog whom bookies were giving 3-1 odds against.That 2012 boxing match marked a pivotal moment in Trudeau?s political career. But his account of the episode is now raising eyebrows, after he offered a glimpse into his decision to take on indigenous politician Patrick Brazeau.?It wasn?t random,? Trudeau told Rolling Stone magazine in an interview published this week. ?I wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy tough-guy senator from an indigenous community. He fit the bill, and it was a very nice counterpoint. I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.?The comments ? part of a 6,800-word August cover story on the prime minister ? sparked immediate reaction. ?So ?privileged white guy beats up Indian? was the ?right kind of narrative?? Seriously?? wrote one person on Twitter, while another noted: ?White guy in power & entitlement looks 4 an #Indigenous human to beat up so he looks like a strong white dude. How precious & colonial supreme.?Others pointed to Trudeau?s much vaunted commitments to diversity and tackling the deep-rooted inequities facing many indigenous peoples in Canada. ?What is up @JustinTrudeau after all your talk of inclusion you brag about beating up a guy with the issues you swore to address,? tweeted one. Another said: ?Trudeau literally using indigenous people as political props.? The encounter came to a halt in the third round as Trudeau pummelled Brazeau in a corner, but it marked the beginning of Trudeau?s rise to Canada?s top office. Brazeau ? who told reporters after the match that it was his ego, not his reddened nose, that was most hurt ? would later be cast out of the Conservative caucus following a 2013 arrest for sexual assault and domestic abuse.As Trudeau?s description of planning the boxing match made the rounds online, some questioned how it squared with Trudeau?s promise to repair the country?s relationship with the more than 1.4 million indigenous peoples ? many of whom grapple with rates of poverty, incarceration and suicide that are much higher than non-indigenous Canadians.Many continue to reel from the effects of Canada?s church-run residential school system ? described by last year?s truth commission as a tool of cultural genocide ? while systemic inequalities have left some living in inadequate, overcrowded housing with undrinkable water.Algonquin artist Jay Odjick pointed to Trudeau?s comments as a possible explanation for the slow pace of reconciliation. ?Canada, your leader went to US media today saying that when he needed a villain to fit his narrative, an indigenous person was a good fit,? he wrote on Twitter. ?The sad fact is, WE are the only people he could get away with in terms of this. Think about perception if he had chosen another PoC person.? On Thursday, Trudeau?s office pointed to the launch of a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous girls and women as well as government promises for investment in education, infrastructure and healthcare to highlight the prime minister?s commitment to Indigenous issues. ?He has made it clear that there is no relationship more important to him ? and to our government ? than reconciliation with Indigenous peoples,? a spokesperson for Trudeau said in a statement to the Guardian. ?We are fully committed to a renewed nation-to-nation relationship and to reconciliation.?The Rolling Stone interview ? promoted on the magazine with the question ?Why can?t he be our president?? ? prompted intense debate in Canada. Many lauded the profile, which included phrases such as ?For Trudeau, listening is seducing? and sought to contrast Trudeau with Donald Trump. Polls suggest Trudeau?s approval rating among Canadians remains high, at around 53%, 20 months after his government took power. But others reacted with skepticism, pointing to Trudeau?s broken promises on electoral reform and deficit spending as well as his government?s sluggish response in addressing indigenous issues.?This yearning for an anti-Trump to call their own means the US media are glossing over or ignoring the troubling similarities between both leaders, not the least of which is an obsession with celebrity that is ultimately counterproductive to governance,? wrote Toronto Star columnist Vinay Menon. ?The attention might be nice. But a bit more neighbourly honesty would be even better.?"

It directed the state to provide basic facilities such as clean drinking water, mattresses, healthcare, toilets etc.These schools, meant primarily for children from tribal areas in the state, battle neglect and government apathy. The direction came while the bench was hearing a public interest litigation claiming that 793 children had died over the past 10 years in various ashram schools. The reasons for these deaths ranged from snake bites to fevers to other illnesses. ?This is really ridiculous. The state government is obligated to provide basic facilities. It is the government?s duty and responsibility. Except passing hollow resolutions, the government has done little to improve the condition,? the bench said. ?Immediate action must be taken to provide basic facilities such as clean and adequate number of toilets, drinking water facility, medical treatment, beddings and mattresses in hostels etc. The government must also appoint a female warden in each school that has girl students,? the bench said.

"A Delhi couple, currently lodged in Tihar jail, have been running a prostitution ring from the prison, according to reports. This came to light after a 16-year-old girl was rescued from a brothel, which is owned by the couple. The duo has been involved in trafficking girls and forcing them into prostitution reportedly for the past 17 years.","Summarise: The rescue of a 16-year-old girl from Delhi?s red light district on Monday brought the Capital?s wide-spread prostitution racket under spotlight. The girl was rescued by the West Bengal Police from brothel number 56, which is owned by a couple lodged in Tihar jail. Afaq Husain and Saria Begum have been allegedly trafficking girls and forcing them into prostitution for the past 17 years. They have been arrested at least seven times in the past and are currently booked under the non-bailable Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). However, this has failed to stop the racket they run at Delhi?s red light district ? GB Road. Monday?s rescue operation came after raids at the same brothel in August in which the couple was arrested. It raised questions on the crime branch?s claim that the prostitution syndicate run by the couple had been busted.The rescued girl, who is from Durgapur in West Bengal, was trafficked in 2014 and forced into prostitution. ?The girl took a mobile phone from a customer and called her father. We traced the location through the phone call and contacted the local police. The girl was rescued from the brothel,? said Umakant of the West Bengal Police, who is the investigating officer in the case.According to the Delhi Police crime branch, over 80% business at GB Road is controlled by two-three operators, who have their own network of agents. Afaq and Saria are allegedly the influential operators who control everything from a distant location through handpicked brothel managers.?The fact that the Delhi Police had raided the same place in August 2016, when this girl was probably confined there, says a lot about the nexus of the traffickers. Instead of just arresting the traffickers, the police must break the nexus,? said Rishi Kant of the Shakti Vahini NGO, who assisted the West Bengal Police in the operation.The crime branch admitted that girls are sold to the brothel owners for Rs 1 lakh and the victims are confined in hidden cells, thrashed, intoxicated, starved and forced into commercial activity.?While the victims are compelled to live in terrible conditions, their distressed family members keep running from pillar to post to trace them. The crime branch studied the crime pattern to institute effective action against the key perpetrators and real beneficiaries of this illegal trade,? the crime branch said in August.The Delhi Police has also proposed to seal the brothel owned by the couple and the matter is pending in the court.?At the time of rescue, our team had asked the girls if they wanted to come with us as there are many adult girls who prefer to stay. Those, who agreed, were rescued while the rest were allowed to stay. The couple is still in jail,? said a senior crime branch official.The victims, most of whom are minors from poor families, are trafficked from Nepal and various other parts of the country by agents in an organised manner. The girls are brought to Delhi on the pretext of lucrative jobs and marriage."

"Saint Teresa's blue-bordered sari was recognised as an Intellectual Property of the Missionaries of Charity after she was cannonised last year, reports said. The charity made the trademark public recently after it witnessed ""unfair usage of the design across the globe."" It is the first time that a uniform has been protected under the Intellectual Property rights, reports added.","Summarise: Amitava Roy Kolkata, July 9 (PTI) The famous blue-bordered sari of Mother Teresa, who has been canonised as Saint Teresa of Calcutta by the Vatican, has been recognised as an Intellectual Property of the Missionaries of Charity. ""The Trade Marks Registry, Government of India, has granted the registration of the trade mark for that pattern of blue border of sari,"" Intellectual Property attorney Biswajit Sarkar said. The diminutive nun of Albanian descent went around the streets of Kolkata since 1948 to be with the poor and the destitutes wearing a white sari with three blue borders, the outer border being wider than the two inner ones. ""The blue-designed border on the sari worn by nuns of the Missionaries of Charity was recognised as Intellectual Property for the organisation on September four, 2016, the day the Mother was canonised,"" Sarkar told PTI here. ""The Missionaries of Charity does not believe in publicity and as such it was not publicised, but since we are witnessing unscrupulous and unfair usage of the design across the globe, we are now trying to spread awareness among people about the trademark,"" Sarkar said. ""The blue border pattern is a distinctive symbolic identity of the Missionaries of Charity under the concept of colour trade mark protection,"" he said. Applications were filed before the Trade Marks Registry on December 12, 2013 and after ""a stringent test of legal proceedings"" for nearly three years, the registrations were granted. In order to mark the sainthood of Mother Teresa, the Government of India granted the trade mark registration on the same day on September four, 2016, despite it being a Sunday, Sarkar said. The exclusive right of use of the said blue pattern on white saris adopted by the Missionaries of Charity is unique and is the first time ever that a uniform has been protected under the Intellectual Property rights, the attorney said. Born in 1910 at Skopje in Macedonia in a Catholic family and baptised as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, she came to India in 1929 as Sister Mary Teresa and went to Darjeeling for her novitiate period. She later came to Kolkata and was assigned as a teacher at Saint Marys High School for Girls before she was given consent by her convent in 1948 to work for the poor. "
"Sunil Gavaskar became the first batsman to register 10,000 runs in Test cricket on March 7, 1987. Batting against Pakistan in Ahmedabad, Gavaskar, needing 58 runs to reach the milestone, scored 63 runs in India's first innings. The batsman went on to register 10,122 runs in his Test career before retiring after his 125th Test match.","Summarise: Talk about small steps and giant leaps. On March 7, 1987, a quick single nudged through the slips to a Pakistani bowler named Ejaz Fakih took Sunil Manohar Gavaskar from his innings score of 57 to 58 at the Sardar Patel Stadium in rural Motera outside Ahmedabad. That run also took Gavaskar to a territory which, never mind the batsman, even cricket itself had never seen. Fifty seven to fifty eight sent Gavaskar from 9,999 to the first 10,000th run in Test cricket. Non-striker Kiran More says Gavaskar celebrated that moment like he usually didn't do in cricket. He sprinted. Or at least that's what it seemed like to millions watching TV because it was an accomplishment that all of India wanted to own quickly. So we believe that in that instant, this deliberate, determined Indian batsman was quicker than usual. His head slightly lowered, mid-single, Gavaskar raised his bat in both triumph and celebration. AlsoBy evening, he was out for 63 and they say when he returned to the dressing room, at first he was not satisfied, but furious. Gavaskar's principle never changed: every run counted, every innings had to be maximised. So 10,000 had been achieved but to not extend that innings of 63 irked him. If he ever got out after getting in, dressing rooms would usually clear out to give the infuriated maestro his space. When play ended, what he did have though, was contentment, ""I would have just been happy with 1,000 runs. Now I feel 10 times more fantastic."" No wonder, even in the dry state of Gujarat that night, they sourced some champagne to go with the cake. India did not know it then but Gavaskar was to play only one more Test after Ahmedabad. When he retired later that year, the country was in deep gloom: Indian cricket's defender, its most gritty general had gone. He had re-defined the standards of excellence and professionalism, re-written definitions in the school of Indian batsmanship. It is said he has no mementos from the match in which he crossed 10,000, but he wouldn't need any: Sunil Gavaskar's achievement always carries with it the power of everlasting memory. --by Sharda Ugra"
"Billionaire investor George Soros said that UK PM Theresa May will not remain in power for long as Brexit cripples her government, while US President-elect Donald Trump is a ?would-be dictator? who's ?going to fail?. On the eve of Trump?s inauguration as President, Soros further said Trump was an ?impostor and con-man? and was ?gearing up for a trade war?.","Summarise: Theresa May will not remain in power long as Brexit cripples her government, while Donald Trump is a ?would-be dictator? who is ?going to fail?, the billionaire investor George Soros has told the Davos world economic forum.On the eve of Trump?s inauguration as president, Soros delivered a scathing assessment, saying the ?impostor and con-man? was ?gearing up for a trade war? which would have ?a very far-reaching effect in Europe and other parts of the world?.The ?would-be-dictator ? didn?t expect to win, he was surprised?, Soros told an audience of business leaders and journalists in Davos where the World Economic Forum is being held.?I personally have confidence that he?s going to fail ? because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory,? added Soros, who was a supporter of Trump?s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election campaign.Soros said he expected financial markets to ?not do very well? because of the uncertainty generated by the Trump administration.On Theresa May and Brexit, Soros predicted economic upheaval in Britain and substantial difficulties in bringing about a clean break with the European Union ? and the prospect of the UK quickly joining again or entering a successor arrangement once the referendum mandate of leaving the EU was fulfilled.?In my opinion it is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament. And I think she will not last,? he said.?At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted and they live in hope. But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards.?This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they?ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won?t rise as fast as the cost of living.?The divorce is going to take a very long time. It?s much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU, because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning.?Soros said he hoped both sides would realise they must find some common ground and find common ground to avoid a bitter divorce.The future for Europe looked bleak, Soros said, after a disastrous 2016. Europe had become too complicated, leaving people alienated and anti-European parties gathering force.May, speaking earlier at the forum, said Britain had voted with ?determination and quiet resolve? to leave the EU but it was ?overwhelmingly? in Britain?s interests for Europe to succeed.?Britain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world. It means accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for our country?s children, and grandchildren too.?We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again.?With the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse"
"Kerala Police has arrested a production executive named Kiran Kumar following a complaint filed by Malayalam actress Mythili after he posted her private pictures on social media. Kiran and Mythili were reportedly in a relationship also, which Mythili is said to have ended when she got to know that Kumar was married. He was allegedly blackmailing the actress for ransom.","Summarise: Yet another blackmail bid in the Malayalam film industry has come to light with the arrest of a production executive on Sunday following the complaint of actor Mythili. The Ernakulam North Police arrested Kiran Kumar (38), who hails from Palakkad for posting defamatory photographs of the actor on social media, according to media reports.?Kumar was in a relationship with the actress during 2008. However, she ended the relationship when she came to know he was married,? the reports quoted a police officer as saying.?Subsequently, Kumar used to visit her shooting locations and residence and create scenes. He demanded Rs 75 lakh and threatened if she failed to give the money he will post sensitive photos he took on social media. As she complained about the matter to the police, he did not upload the photos at the time,? the New Indian Express quoted the officer as saying. However things changed after she gained popularity and he decided to upload the said pictures. The actor?s pictures with the man soon went viral on Whatsapp and Facebook. It was then that the actor complained to the police.?The preliminary inquiry suggests a few persons are also involved in propagating the photographs on social networking sites. They will also be arrested,? said Ernakulam assistant commissioner K Laljy. The accused has been booked under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of IPC and 66 (A) of the IT Act, one of the reports said.Follow @htshowbiz for more"
"Confectionery multinational NestlÃ© has lost its bid against Cadbury to register the shape of the four-finger KitKat chocolate as a trademark, marking its fourth unsuccessful attempt to do so. The court ruled the four-finger design had ""no inherent distinctiveness"" and the shape was not a ""badge or origin"". This will let competitors produce their own KitKat copies without legal consequences.","Summarise: It?s enough to make anyone need a sit-down with a cup of tea and a four-fingered chocolate wafer biscuit. The confectionery multinational NestlÃ© has lost the latest round of its long-running battle with rivals Cadbury to trademark the shape of the KitKat bar in the UK. The court of appeal ruled that the four-finger design had ?no inherent distinctiveness?.After deliberating for months, the three appeals judges delivered their judgment on Wednesday in a 16,000-word ruling that found the KitKat shape was not a ?badge of origin?.?We are concerned here with ... the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product, that has no inherent distinctiveness,? said Lord Justice Kitchin.The ruling marks the latest stage in a bitter-tasting battle between NestlÃ© and Mondel?z, the US owner of Cadbury, that have been battling over the KitKat trademark for seven years.Nestle?s appeal followed a UK high court ruling in January last year that blocked the trademark attempt. The European court of justice had previously found that the four-fingered shape, breaking apart with a snap, was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with European law.The ruling clears the way for competitors, including the major supermarkets as well as other confectioners, to produce their own copycat KitKats without fear of legal consequences.But a NestlÃ© spokesperson indicated the Swiss firm was not necessarily prepared to give up, saying it was considering its next move. The company could potentially try to take the case to the UK supreme court.?NestlÃ© is disappointed by the court of appeal judgment and is considering its next steps,? said the spokesperson. ?KitKat is much loved around the world and its four-finger shape is well known by consumers. NestlÃ©?s four-finger shape has been granted trademark registration in many countries of the world, for instance Germany, France, Australia, South Africa and Canada, further protecting it from imitations.?Following the appeal ruling, a Mondel?z spokesperson said: ?As we have previously stated, we do not believe the shape of the KitKat bar should be protected as a trademark in the UK.?The case turned on whether a the product?s shapewas sufficiently distinctive to the brand to prevent any other manufacturer using a similar format. Protected ?shape marks? are not without precedent ? Toblerone, which is owned by Mondel?z, has successfully trademarked its ?zigzag prism? shape.But the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be ?very well known? in association with KitKat, ?that does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source.?They might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar.?These kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.?The judges also noted that the chocolate bar?s shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: ?It has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.?The judges heard that NestlÃ© had spent between Â£3m and Â£11m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007. More than 40m were sold in Britain in 2010.?The appeal court?s ruling indicates that shape marks are going to be increasingly difficult to obtain,? said Guy Wilmot, partner who specialises in intellectual property law at Russell-Cooke.?The court were ... concerned that if they granted the trade mark, NestlÃ© would have a potentially permanent monopoly on the four-finger shape, which they felt would be unfair given that KitKat had never used the shape alone to promote KitKats.?Clare Jackman, an intellectual property lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright, said the fact the two multinationals were prepared to battle through the courts for so long showed the value of what was at stake. ?Trademarks are very important and valuable business assets. They confer monopoly rights, so I can see entirely why NestlÃ© thought, ?our four-finger bar KitKat has been around for ages, let?s register it, because we can stop anyone from producing a bar in four fingers??, she said.?It is typically brand owners in this space that will spend the money and push the boundaries, in trying to get as much protection as possible, because at the end of the day trademarks can potentially last forever, so it really is a signficant monopoly right.?Asked if she could foresee a challenge in supreme court, Jackman said: ?I?m not going to rule it out, because I think these are two brand owners who are prepared to push this as far as it can go.?The four-fingered battle is not the only protracted legal disputes between the two confectioners. In 2004, Cadbury attempted to trademark the shade of purple it uses for its Dairy Milk bars, registering Pantone 2685C in a move that was initially successful before the court of appeal backed NestlÃ© challenge in 2013. An attempt last year by Cadbury to resurrect an earlier trademark on the colour was rejected by the high court.The first KitKat-type bar was sold in Britain by Rowntree in 1935, when it was called Chocolate Crisp, and the shape has changed little since then. NestlÃ© acquired Rowntree in 1998.A lookalike called Kvikk Lunsj, translated as ?quick lunch?, launched in Norway in 1937 and is available in some UK shops.? This article was amended on 18 May 2017. The judge?s ruling was not a ?badge of origin?, a previous version said the judge?s ruling was not a ?badge or origin?."

"Railway Ministry is planning to introduce an integrated ticketing system in the next three years, which will be first introduced in Mumbai on pilot basis. The system will provide all-in-one tickets for all public transportation in the city including BEST buses, local trains, Metros, black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws. The MMRDA will reportedly float a tender for the system in October.","Summarise: The railway ministry plans to introduce its ambitious integrated ticketing system in the next three years and Mumbai will be the first city to experience it. The project will be implemented in the city on a pilot basis and if it?s successful, it will be introduced in other metro cities. Primarily a Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) project, the system will integrate all public transport ? BEST buses, local trains, metros, black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws. The ministry hopes that more than 80 % of the city?s suburban commuters will opt for the all-in-one tickets. Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) and Central and Western Railway officials are currently studying different ways to sync the new software with the existing system. The project will be executed in two stages: in the first, the software will be integrated with the existing ticketing system and in the second, entry and exit gates will be installed at stations. Railway authorities also hope the new ticketing system will reduce losses as it will need less manpower. The railway panel?s findings will be submitted to MMRDA and the railway board in August. ?MRVC will present the railways? perspective to the MMRDA, which is the primary organisation for the integrated ticketing system,? said Prabhat Sahai, chairman and MD, MRVC.Sources said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is keen on the project.  The Brihamumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), which runs bus services, and Mumbai Metro One Private Limited (MMOPL), which manages the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro, have agreed to modify their ticketing systems for the new tickets. With new Metro lines coming up in the city, MMRDA said the single ticketing system would be a boon to travellers. The consultants for the Metro lines will submit a detailed report to the body on the system?s implementation. According to sources, the MMRDA is likely to float a tender for the single ticket system in October."
